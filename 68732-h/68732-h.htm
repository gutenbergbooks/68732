<p class="drop-cap">THE truth is, John,” said Mr. Wilson to his
brother, “I am troubled about my boy.
Here it is the first of July, and he can’t go
back to school until the middle of September. He
will be idle all that time, and I’m afraid he’ll get
into mischief. Now, the other day I found him reading
a wretched story about pirates. Why should a
son of mine care to read about pirates?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s a boy. All boys like piratical stories.
I know, when I was a boy, I thought that if I
could be either a pirate or a stage-driver I should be
perfectly happy. Of course you don’t want Harry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
to read rubbish; but it doesn’t follow because a boy
reads stories about piracy, that he wants to commit
murder and robbery. I didn’t want to kill anybody:
I wanted to be a moral and benevolent pirate.
But here comes Harry across the lawn. What
will you give me if I will find something for him to
do this summer that will make him forget all about
piracy?”</p>

<p>“I only wish you would. Tell me what your
plan is.”</p>

<p>“Come here a minute, Harry,” said Uncle John.
“Now own up; do you like books about pirates?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, uncle, I do.”</p>

<p>“So did I when I was your age. I thought it
would be the best fun in the world to be a Red Revenger
of the Seas.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it, though!” exclaimed Harry. “I
don’t mean it would be fun to kill people, and to
steal watches, but to have a schooner of your own,
and go cruising everywhere, and have storms and—and—hurricanes,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Why shouldn’t you do it this summer?” asked
Uncle John. “If you want to cruise in a craft of
your own, you shall do it; that is, if your father
doesn’t object. A schooner would be a little too big
for a boy of thirteen; but you and two or three other
fellows might make a splendid cruise in a row-boat.
You could have a mast and sail, and you could take
provisions and things, and cruise from Harlem all
the way up into the lakes in the Northern woods.
It would be all the same as piracy, except that you
would not be committing crimes, and making innocent
people wretched.”</p>

<p>“Uncle John, it would be just gorgeous! We’d
have a gun and a lot of fishing-lines, and we could
live on fish and bears. There’s bears in the woods,
you know.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find many bears, I’m afraid; but you
would have to take a gun, and you might possibly
find a wild-cat or two. Who is there that would go
with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s Tom Schuyler, and Joe and Jim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Sharpe; and there’s Sam M‘Grath—though he’d be
quarrelling all the time. Maybe Charley Smith’s
father would let him go. He is a first-rate fellow.
You’d ought to see him play base-ball once!”</p>

<p>“Three boys besides yourself would be enough.
If you have too many, there will be too much risk of
quarrelling. There is one thing you must be sure of—no
boy must go who can’t swim.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all the fellows can swim, except Bill Town.
He was pretty near drowned last summer. He’d
been bragging about what a stunning swimmer he
was, and the boys believed him; so one day one of
the fellows shoved him off the float, where we go
in swimming at our school, and he thought he was
dead for sure. The water was only up to his neck,
but he couldn’t swim a stroke.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you can get three good fellows to go
with you—boys that you know are not blackguards,
but are the kind of boys that your father would be
willing to have you associate with—I’ll give you a
boat and a tent, and you shall have a better cruise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
than any pirate ever had; for no real pirate ever
found any fun in being a thief and a murderer. You
go and see Tom and the Sharpe boys, and tell them
about it. I’ll see about the boat as soon as you have
shipped your crew.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure that your plan is a good
one?” asked Mr. Wilson, as the boy vanished, with
sparkling eyes, to search for his comrades. “Isn’t it
very risky to let the boys go off by themselves in a
boat? Won’t they get drowned?”</p>

<p>“There is always more or less danger in boating,”
replied Uncle John; “but the boys can swim; and
they cannot learn prudence and self-reliance without
running some risks. Yes, it is a good plan, I am
sure. It will give them plenty of exercise in the
open air, and will teach them to like manly, honest
sports. You see that the reason Harry likes piratical
stories is his natural love of adventure. I venture
to predict that if their cruise turns out well, those
four boys will think stories of pirates are stupid as
well as silly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>So the matter was decided. Harry found that
Tom Schuyler and the Sharpe boys were delighted
with the plan, and Uncle John soon obtained the
consent of Mr. Schuyler and Mr. Sharpe. The boys
immediately began to make preparations for the
cruise; and Uncle John bought a row-boat, and employed
a boat-builder to make such alterations as
were necessary to fit his for service.</p>

<p>The boat was what is called a Whitehall row-boat.
She was seventeen feet long, and rowed very easily,
and she carried a small mast with a spritsail. By
Uncle John’s orders an air-tight box, made of tin,
was fitted into each end of the boat, so that, even
if she were to be filled with water, the air in the tin
boxes would float her. She was painted white outside,
with a narrow blue streak, and dark brown inside.
Harry named her the <i>Whitewing</i>; and his
mother made a beautiful silk signal for her, which
was to be carried at the sprit when under sail, and
on a small staff at the bow of the boat at other
times. For oars there were two pairs of light seven-foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
sculls, and a pair of ten-foot oars, each of which
was to be pulled by a single boy. The rudder was
fitted with a yoke and a pair of lines, and the sail
was of new and very light canvas. On one side of
the boat was a little locker, made to hold a gun;
and on the other side were places for fishing-rods
and fishing-tackle. When she was brought around
to Harlem, and Harry saw her for the first time, he
was so overjoyed that he turned two or three hand-springs,
bringing up during the last one against a
post—an exploit which nearly broke his shin, and
induced his uncle to remark that he would never
rise to distinction as a Moral Pirate unless he could
give up turning hand-springs while on duty.</p>

<div class="figcenter"  id="13a"><img src="images/i_012b.jpg" alt="THE WHITEWING AT HARLEM" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE “WHITEWING” AT HARLEM.</p>

<p>Harry could row very fairly, for he belonged to a
boat-club at school. It was not very much of a club;
but then the club-boat was not very much of a boat,
being a small, flat-bottomed skiff, which leaked so
badly that she could not be kept afloat unless one
boy kept constantly at work bailing. However,
Harry learned to row in her, and he now found this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
knowledge very useful. He was anxious to start on
the cruise immediately, but his uncle insisted that
the crew must first be trained. “I must teach you
to sail, and you must teach your crew to row,” said
Uncle John. “The Department will never consent
to let a boat go on a cruise unless her commander
and her crew know their duty.”</p>

<p>“What’s the Department?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“The Navy Department in the United States service
has the whole charge of the Navy, and sends vessels
where it pleases. Now, I consider that I represent
a Department of Moral Piracy, and I therefore
superintend the fitting out of the <i>Whitewing</i>. You
can’t expect moral piracy to flourish unless you respect
the Department, and obey its orders.”</p>

<p>“All right, uncle,” replied Harry. “Of course the
Department furnishes stores and everything else for
a cruise, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it must,” said his uncle, laughing. “I
didn’t think of that when I proposed to become a
department.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>The boys met every day at Harlem and practised
rowing. Uncle John taught them how to sail the
boat, by letting them take her out under sail when
there was very little breeze, while he kept close
along-side in another boat very much like the <i>Whitewing</i>.
Harry sat in the stern-sheets, holding the
yoke-lines. Tom Schuyler, who was fourteen years
old, and a boy of more than usual prudence, sat on
the nearest thwart and held the sheet, which passed
under a cleat without being made fast to it, in his
hand. Next came Jim Sharpe, whose business it was
to unship the mast when the captain should order
sail to be taken in; and on the forward thwart sat
Joe Sharpe, who was not quite twelve, and who kept
the boat-hook within reach, so as to use it on coming
to shore. The boys kept the same positions when
rowing, Tom Schuyler being the stroke. Uncle John
told them that if every one always had the same
seat, and had a particular duty assigned to him, it
would prevent confusion and dispute, and greatly
increase the safety of the vessel and crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>It was not long before Harry could sail the boat
nicely, and the others, by attending closely to Uncle
John’s lessons, learned almost as much as their young
captain. So far as boat-sailing can be taught in fair
weather, Harry was carefully and thoroughly taught
in six or seven lessons, and could handle the <i>Whitewing</i>
beautifully; but the ability to judge of the
weather, to tell when it is going to blow, and how
the wind will probably shift, can of course be learned
only by actual experience.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_017.jpg" width="75" height="87" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Uncle John announced that the Department
was satisfied with the ability of
the captain and crew to manage the <i>Whitewing</i>,
the day for sailing was fixed, and the boys
laid in their stores. Each one had a fishing-line
and hooks, and Harry and Tom each took a fishing-pole—two
poles being as many as were needed,
since most of the fishing would probably be done
with drop-lines. Uncle John lent Harry his double-barrelled
gun, and a supply of ammunition. Each
boy took a tin plate, a tin cup, knife, fork, and spoon.
For cooking purposes, the boat carried a coffee-pot,
two tin cake-pans, which could be used as frying-pans
as well as for other purposes, and two small
tin pails. Harry’s mother lent him several large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
round tin boxes, in which were stored four pounds
of coffee, two pounds of sugar, a pound of Indian
meal, a large quantity of crackers, some salt, and a
little pepper. The rest of the provisions consisted
of two cans of soup, two cans of corned-beef, a can of
roast-beef, two small cans of devilled chicken, four
cans of fresh peaches, a little package of condensed
beef for making beef-tea, and a cold boiled ham.
The boat was furnished with an <b>A</b> tent, four rubber
blankets and four woollen blankets, a hatchet, a
quantity of spare cordage, a little bull’s-eye lantern,
which burnt olive-oil, a few copper nails, a pair of
pliers, and a small piece of zinc and a little white-lead
for mending a leak. Of course there was a bottle
of oil for the lantern; and Mrs. Schuyler added
a little box of pills and a bottle of “Hamlin’s Mixture”
as medical stores. The boys wore blue flannel
trousers and shirts, and each one carried an extra
pair of trousers, and an extra shirt instead of a coat.
These, with a few pairs of stockings and two or three
handkerchiefs, were all the clothing that they needed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
so Uncle John said; though the boys had imagined
that they must take at least two complete
suits. He showed them that two flannel shirts worn
at the same time, one over the other, would be as
warm as one shirt and a coat, and that if their clothing
became wet, it could be easily dried. “Flannel
and the compass are the two things that are indispensable
to navigation,” said Uncle John: “if flannel
shirts had not been invented, Columbus would
never have crossed the Atlantic.” Perhaps there
was a little exaggeration in this; but when we remember
that flannel is the only material that is
warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather, and
that dries almost as soon as it is wrung out and
hung in the wind, it is difficult to see how sailors
could do without it.</p>

<p>The boys agreed very readily to take with them
only what Uncle John advised. Tom Schuyler, however,
was very anxious to take a heavy iron vise,
which he said could be screwed on the gunwale of
the boat, and might prove to be very useful, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
he could not say precisely what he expected
to use it for. Joe Sharpe also wanted to take a base-ball
and bat, but neither the vise nor the ball and
bat were taken.</p>

<p>The <i>Whitewing</i> started from the foot of East
127th Street, on a Monday morning in the middle
of July, at about nine o’clock. Quite a small crowd
of friends were present to see the boys off, and the
neat appearance of the boat and her crew attracted
the attention of all the idlers along the shore.
When all the cargo was stowed, and everything was
ready, Uncle John called the boys aside, and said,
“Now, boys, you must sign the articles.”</p>

<p>“What are articles?” asked all the boys at once.</p>

<p>“They are certain regulations, which every respectable
pirate, or any other sailor for that matter, must
agree to keep when he joins a ship. I’ll read the
articles, and if any of you don’t like any one of them
say so frankly, for you must not begin a cruise in a
dissatisfied state of mind. Here are the articles:</p>

<p>“‘I. <i>We, the captain and crew of the</i> Whitewing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
<i>promise to decide all disputed questions by the vote
of the majority, except questions concerning the management
of the boat. The orders of the captain, in all
matters connected with the management of the boat,
shall be promptly obeyed by the crew.</i>’</p>

<p>“Now, if anybody thinks that the captain should
not have the full control of the boat, let him say
so at once. Very likely the captain will make mistakes;
but the boat will be safer, even if the crew
obeys a wrong order, than it would be if every order
should be debated by the crew. You can’t hold
town-meetings when you are afloat. Harry, I think,
understands pretty well how to sail the boat. Will
you agree to obey his orders?”</p>

<p>All the boys said they would; and Joe Sharpe
added that he thought the captain ought to have the
right to put mutineers in irons.</p>

<p>“That, let us hope, will not be necessary,” said
Uncle John. “Now listen to the second article:</p>

<p>“‘II. <i>We promise not to take corn, apples, or other
property without permission of the owner.</i>’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“You will very likely camp near some field where
corn, or potatoes, or something eatable, is growing.
Many people think there is no harm in taking a few
ears of corn or a half-dozen apples. I want you to
remember that to take anything that is not your
own, unless you have permission to do so, is stealing.
It’s an ugly word, but it can’t be smoothed over in
any way. Do you object to this article?”</p>

<p>Nobody objected to it. “We’re moral pirates,
Uncle John,” said Tom Schuyler, “and we won’t disgrace
the Department by stealing.”</p>

<p>“I know you would not, except through thoughtlessness.
Now these are all the articles. I did think
of asking you not to quarrel or to use bad language,
but I don’t believe it is necessary to ask you to
make such a promise, and if it were, you probably
would not keep it. So, sign the articles, give them
to the captain, and take your stations.”</p>

<p>The articles were signed. The captain seated himself
in the stern-sheets, and took the yoke-lines. The
rest took their proper places, and Joe Sharpe held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the boat to the dock by the boat-hook. “Are you
all ready?” cried Uncle John. “All ready, sir!” answered
Harry. “Then give way with your oars!
Good-bye, boys, and don’t forget to send reports to
the Department.”</p>

<p>The boat glided away from the shore with Tom
and Jim each pulling a pair of sculls. The group on
the dock gave the boys a farewell cheer, and in a few
moments they were hid from sight by the Third Avenue
bridge. The tide was against them, but the
day was a cool one for the season, and the boys rowed
steadily on in the very best of spirits. There was
a light south wind, but, as there were several bridges
to pass, Harry thought it best not to set the sail before
reaching the Hudson River. It required careful
steering to avoid the steamboats, bridge-piles, and
small boats; but the <i>Whitewing</i> was guided safely,
and her signal—a red flag with a white cross—floated
gayly at the bow.</p>

<p>Uncle John had made one serious mistake: he had
forgotten all about the tide, and never thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the difficulty the boys would find in passing Farmersbridge
with the tide against them. They had passed
High Bridge, and had entered a part of the river
with which the boys were not familiar, when Joe
Sharpe suddenly called out, “There’s a low bridge
right ahead that we can’t pass.” A few more
strokes of the oars enabled Harry to see a long low
bridge, which completely blocked up the river except
at one place, that seemed not much wider than the
boat. Through this narrow channel the tide was
rushing fiercely, the water heaping itself up in waves
that looked unpleasantly high and rough. The boat
was rowed as close as possible to the opening under
the bridge; but the current was so strong that the
boys could not row against it, and even if they had
been able to stem it, the channel was too narrow to
permit them to use the oars.</p>

<p>Harry ordered the boat to be rowed up to the
bridge at a place where there was a quiet eddy, and
all the crew went ashore to contrive some way of
overcoming the difficulty. Presently Harry thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
of a plan. “If we could get the painter under the
bridge, we could pull the boat through easy enough
if there was nobody in her.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” said Joe, “but how are you
going to get the painter through?”</p>

<p>“I know,” cried Jim. “Let’s take a long piece of
rope and drop it in the water the other side of the
bridge. The current will float it through, and we
can catch it and tie it to the painter.”</p>

<p>The plan seemed a good one; and so the boys took
a piece of spare rope from the boat, tied a bit of board
to one end of it for a float, dropped the float into
the water, and held on to the other end of the rope.
When the float came in sight below the bridge they
caught it with the boat-hook, and, throwing away
the piece of board, tied the rope to the painter.
“Now let Joe Sharpe get in the bow of the boat, to
keep her from running against anything, and we’ll
haul her right through,” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>Joe took his place in the bow, and, pushing the
boat off, let her float into the current. Then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
three other boys pulled on the rope, and were delighted
to see the boat glide under the bridge. Suddenly
Joe gave a wild yell. “She’s sinking, boys!”
he cried: “let go the rope, or I’ll be drowned!” The
boys, terribly frightened, dropped the rope, and in another
minute the boat floated back on the current,
half full of water, and without Joe. Almost as soon
as it came in sight, Harry had thrown off his shoes
and jumped into the river.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS Harry vanished, Joe’s head appeared, as he
climbed up the side of the bridge and joined
his brother and Tom. Their anxiety was
now for Harry, who had been swept through the
channel under the bridge, and was manfully swimming
toward the eddy where the boys had landed.
He came ashore none the worse for his bath, and was
delighted to find that Joe was not only safe but dry.
Joe explained that the boat had drifted against one
of the piles of the bridge, and the current and the
tow-rope together had forced one of her sides so low
down that the water began to pour in. Joe thought
that if the river intended to get into the boat, he
had better get out; so he sprung up and caught one
of the timbers of the bridge, and so climbed safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
up to the roadway. The boat, relieved of his weight
and freed from the tow-line, drifted quietly away,
and was now floating peacefully on the river about
twenty rods from the shore.</p>

<p>Luckily an old man in a row-boat saw the runaway
<i>Whitewing</i>, and kindly caught her and brought
her up to the bridge. As the boys baled her out,
they told him how the accident happened, and the
gruff old man said it “sarved ’em right.” “When
you tow a boat next time,” he continued, “you’ll
know enough to put all your weight in the stern.
Did you ever see a steamboat towing a row-boat
with a man in the bow? If ever you do, you’ll see
him going overboard mighty quick. A boat’ll sheer
all over creation if you tow her with a fellow in the
bow. You just put the biggest of you fellows in
the stern of that there boat, and she’ll go through
under the bridge just as steady as a church.”</p>

<p>The boys gladly took the old man’s advice. When
the boat was baled out, they floated the rope down
again, and when it was made fast, Tom Schuyler, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
was the heaviest of the boys, offered to sit in the
stern. His weight brought the bow of the boat out
of the water, and she was towed quickly and safely
through. The boys resumed their places as soon as
Harry had put on dry clothes, and after a short and
easy row glided under the Spuyten Duyvel railway
bridge, and found themselves on the broad and placid
Hudson. They rowed on for nearly a mile, and
then, having found a little sandy cove, ran the boat
aground, and went ashore to rest. After a good
swim, which all greatly enjoyed, including Harry,
who said that his recent bath at Farmersbridge
ought not to be counted, since it was more of a duty
than a pleasure, they sat down to eat a nice cold
lunch of ham sandwiches that Mrs. Wilson had kindly
prepared; and when they were no longer hungry,
they stretched themselves lazily in the shade.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Harry, “we made a big mistake
at the bridge; but we learned something, and we
won’t get the boat swamped that way again.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully obliged to Harry for jumping in after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
me,” said Joe; “but it’s the first time I ever
heard of a captain jumping over after a sailor.
When a sailor falls overboard, the captain just stands
on the deck and looks around, kind of careless like,
while the second mate and four sailors jump into a
boat and pick the man up. That’s the way it’s done;
for I know a fellow that saw a man fall overboard
on a steamship, and he said that was how the captain
did.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Harry; “I won’t jump in for
you again, Joe. The fact is, boys, I oughtn’t to have
done it without waiting to find out whether there
was really anything the matter with Joe. I’ll tell
you what we’ll do. Joe is a first-rate swimmer, and
we’ll make a rule that whenever anybody is to jump
into the river for anything, Joe shall do it. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m willing enough,” said Joe. “I don’t care
who jumps as long as the captain don’t. It won’t
look well for the captain to be all the time jumping
overboard to pick somebody up.”</p>

<p>“A better rule,” remarked Tom, “would be that
no fellow shall fall overboard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“I move to amend that,” cried Jim, “by forbidding
any accidents to happen to any of us.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t do that,” said Tom, who never
understood a joke. “Accidents never would happen
if people could help themselves.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry, “if the rest of you will agree
not to fall overboard, I’ll promise that the captain
sha’n’t spend all his time in jumping after you. But
if you are all ready, we’d better start on. There’s a
nice little breeze, and we can rest in the boat.”</p>

<p>By this time Harry’s shirt and trousers, which had
been wrung out and hung up on a bush, were perfectly
dry. He packed them away with his rubber
blanket rolled tightly around them, and Jim attended
to the duty of stepping the mast. Then the boys
took their places, and Joe pushed the boat off with
the boat-hook. The gentle breeze filled the sail, and
the <i>Whitewing</i> went peacefully on her way up the
river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Boys,” said Harry, presently, “it’s getting awfully
hot.”</p>

<p>“That’s because we’re sailing right before the
wind,” said Tom. “We are going just about as fast
as the wind goes, and that’s the reason why we don’t
feel it.”</p>

<p>“Is this a lecture on wind, by Professor Thomas
Schuyler?” asked Joe. “Because if it is, I’d rather
hear it when it’s cooler. Let’s go over to the other
side of the river, where we can get in the shade of
the Palisades.”</p>

<p>It was now about three o’clock, and the sun was
very hot. The boat seemed to the boys to creep
across the river, and the Palisades seemed to move
away just as fast as they approached them. When
they finally did come into the shadow of those huge
rocks, they thought they had never known anything
so delightful as the change from the scorching sunshine
to the cool shade. Joe and his brother stretched
themselves out, and put their blankets under their
heads; presently they grew tired of talking, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
a little while they were fast asleep. Tom was not
sleepy; but he was so delighted with the beauty of
the shore, as seen from the boat, that he did not care
to talk.</p>

<p>For a long time the boat glided stealthily along.
The Palisades were passed, and a long pier projecting
into the river from the west shore gradually came
in sight. When the boat came up with the pier, half
a dozen barges lay along-side of it, into which men
were sliding enormous cakes of ice. The Sharpe boys
woke up, and proposed to stop and get a little ice.
The men let them pick up as many small pieces of ice
as they could carry, and they went on their way so
much refreshed that they chattered away as gayly as
possible.</p>

<p>Uncle John had warned them to select a camping-ground
long before dark. They remembered this
advice, and at about five o’clock they landed on a
little low point of land a few miles below the entrance
to the Highlands. They first hauled the boat
a little way up the beach, so that it would be sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
not to float off, and then began to take the tent, the
cooking things, and the provisions for supper out of
her.</p>

<p>“We want to pitch the tent and make a fire,” said
Harry, “and somebody ought to get some milk.
Let’s pitch the tent first.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that,” said Tom, “while you fellows get
the supper.”</p>

<p>“It takes two or three fellows to pitch the tent,”
said Harry; “you can’t do it alone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll undertake to pitch it alone,” replied Tom.
“One of you can get firewood, one can go for milk,
and the other can get out the things for supper.
Here goes for the tent.”</p>

<p>The tent was furnished with two upright poles
and a ridge-pole, each one of which was made in
two pieces and joined together with ferules, like a
fishing-rod. Tom selected a soft sandy spot close by
the water’s edge, where he spread out the tent, and
pinned down each of the four corners with rough
wooden pins, which he cut with the hatchet from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
piece of driftwood. Then he crept under the canvas
with the poles. He put one of the upright poles in
its place with the end of the ridge-pole over it, and
then, holding the other end of the ridge-pole in one
hand, he put the second pole in position with his
other hand, and pushed the end of the ridge-pole
into its proper place. The tent was now pitched;
and all that remained to be done was to tighten the
four corner pegs and to drive in the other ones.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jim had taken one of the pails and
gone toward a distant farm-house for milk. Joe had
collected a pile of firewood, and Harry had lighted
the fire and put the other tin pail half full of water
to boil over it. By the time the water had boiled,
Jim had returned, bringing the milk with him. It
did not take long to make coffee; and then the boys
sat down on the sand, each with a tin cup of hot
coffee at his side, and proceeded to eat a supper of
ham sandwiches and cake. It was not the kind of
supper that they expected to have on subsequent
nights; but Mrs. Wilson’s sandwiches and cake had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to be eaten in order to keep them from spoiling.
After the coffee was gone they each had a cup of
cold milk, and then put the rest of it in a shady
place to be used for breakfast. The provisions were
carefully covered up, so as to protect them in case
of rain, and then the beds were made. This last
operation was a very easy one, since the sand was
soft enough for a mattress, and all that needed to
be done was to spread the rubber blankets on the
ground as a protection from the damp. Then the
boys rolled up their spare clothing for pillows, and,
wrapping themselves in their blankets, were soon
sound asleep.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_037.jpg" width="75" height="88" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME time in the middle of the night Joe
Sharpe woke up from a dream that he had
fallen into the river, and could not get out.
He thought that he had caught hold of the supports
of a bridge, and had drawn himself partly out of the
water, but that he had not strength enough to drag
his legs out, and that, on the contrary, he was slowly
sinking back. When he awoke he found that he
was very cold, and that his blanket felt particularly
heavy. He put his hand down to move the blanket,
when, to his great surprise, he found that he was
lying with his legs in a pool of water.</p>

<p>Joe instantly shouted to the other boys, and told
them to wake up, for it was raining, and the tent
was leaking. As each boy woke up he found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
as wet as Joe, and at first all supposed that it
was raining heavily. They soon found, however, that
no rain-drops were pattering on the outside of the
tent, and that the stars were shining through the open flap.
“There’s water in this tent,” said Tom,
with the air of having made a grand discovery. “If
any of you fellows have been throwing water on me,
it was a mean trick,” said Jim. All at once an idea
struck Harry. “Boys,” he exclaimed, “it’s the tide!
We’ve got to get out of this place mighty quick, or
the tide will wash the tent away.”</p>

<p>The boys sprung up, and rushed out of the tent.
They had gone to bed at low-tide, and as the tide
rose it had gradually invaded the tent. The boat
was still safe, but the water had surrounded it, and
in a very short time would be deep enough to float
it. The tide was still rising, and it was evident that
no time should be lost if the tent was to be saved.</p>

<p>Two of the boys hurriedly seized the blankets and
other articles which were in the tent, and carried them
on to the higher ground; while the other two pulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
up the pins, and dragged the tent out of reach
of the water. Then they pulled the boat farther
up the beach, and, having thus made everything safe,
had leisure to discover that they were miserably
cold, and that their clothes, from the waist down,
were wet through.</p>

<p>Luckily, their spare clothing, which they had used
for pillows, was untouched by the water, so that they
were able to put on dry shirts and trousers. Their
blankets, however, had been thoroughly soaked,
and it was too cold to think of sleeping without
them. There was nothing to be done but to build
a fire, and sit around it until daylight. It was by no
means easy to collect firewood in the dark; and as
soon as a boy succeeded in getting an armful of driftwood,
he usually stumbled and fell down with it.
There was not very much fun in this; but when the
fire finally blazed up, and its pleasant warmth conquered
the cold night air, the boys began to regain
their spirits.</p>

<p>“I wonder what time it is?” said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Tom had a watch, but he had forgotten to wind it
up for two or three nights, and it had stopped at eight
o’clock. The boys were quite sure, however, that they
could not have been asleep more than half an hour.</p>

<p>“It’s about one o’clock,” said Harry, presently.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it’s more than nine,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“We must have gone into the tent about an hour
after sunset,” continued Harry, “and the sun sets between
six and seven. It was low-tide then, and it’s
pretty near high-tide now; and since the tide runs
up for about six hours, it must be somewhere between
twelve and one.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” exclaimed Jim. “Look at the
stars. That bright star over there in the west was
just rising when we went to bed.”</p>

<p>“You ought to say ‘turned in!’” said Joe. “Sailors
never go to bed; they always ‘turn in.’”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t turn in any more to-night,” replied
Tom. “What do you say, boys? suppose we have
breakfast—it’ll pass away the time, and we can have
another breakfast by-and-by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Now that the boys thought of it, they began to
feel hungry, for they had had a very light supper.
Everybody felt that hot coffee would be very nice;
so they all went to work—made coffee, fried a piece
of ham, and, with a few slices of bread, made a capital
breakfast. They wrung out the wet blankets
and clothes, and hung them up by the fire to dry.
Then they had to collect more firewood; and gradually
the faint light of the dawn became visible, before
they really had time to find the task of waiting
for daylight tiresome.</p>

<p>They decided that it would not do to start with
wet blankets, since they could not dry them in the
boat. They therefore continued to keep up a brisk
fire, and to watch the blankets closely, in order to
see that they did not get scorched. After a time the
sun came out bright and hot, and took the drying
business in charge. The boys went into the river,
and had a nice long swim, and then spent some
time in carefully packing everything into the boat.
By the time the blankets were dry, and they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
ready to start, the tide had fallen so low that the
boat was high and dry; and in spite of all their efforts
they could not launch her while she was loaded.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take all the things out of her,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“It reminds me,” remarked Joe, “of Robinson
Crusoe that time he built his big canoe, and then
couldn’t launch it.”</p>

<p>“Robinson wasn’t very sharp,” said Jim. “Why
didn’t he make a set of rollers, and put them on the
boat?”</p>

<p>“Much good rollers would have been,” replied
Joe. “Wasn’t there a hill between the boat and the
water? He couldn’t roll a heavy boat uphill, could
he?”</p>

<p>“He could have made a couple of pulleys, and
rigged a rope through them, and then made a windlass,
and put the rope round it,” argued Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes; and he could have built a steam-engine
and a railroad, and dragged the boat down to the
shore that way, just about as easy.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="43a"><img src="images/i_042b.jpg" alt="IF YOU WANT TO DIG, DIG." /></div>
<p class="caption">“IF YOU WANT TO DIG, DIG. I DON’T INTEND<br /> TO DO ANY MORE
DIGGING.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“He couldn’t dig a canal, for he thought about that,
and found it would take too much work,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“But we can,” cried Harry. “If we just scoop
out a little sand, we can launch the boat with everything
in her!”</p>

<p>The boys liked the idea of a canal; and they each
found a large shingle on the beach, and began to dig.
They dug for nearly an hour, but the boat was no
nearer being launched than when they began. Tom
stopped digging, and made a calculation. “It will
take about two days of hard work to dig a canal
deep enough to float that boat. If you want to dig,
dig; I don’t intend to do any more digging.”</p>

<p>When the other boys considered the matter, they
saw that Tom was right, and they gave up the idea
of making a canal. It was now about ten o’clock,
and they were rather tired and very hungry. A
second breakfast was agreed to be necessary, and
once more the fire was built up and a meal prepared.
Then the boat was unloaded and launched, and the
boys, taking off their shoes and rolling up their trousers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
waded in the water and reloaded her. It was
noon by the sun before they finally had everything
in order and resumed their cruise.</p>

<p>There was no wind, and it was necessary to take
to the oars. The disadvantage of starting at so late
an hour soon became painfully plain. The sun was
so nearly overhead that the heat was almost unbearable,
and there was not a particle of shade. The
boys had not had a full night’s sleep, and had tired
themselves before starting by trying to dig a canal.
Of course the labor of rowing in such circumstances
was very severe; and it was not long before first one
and then another proposed to go ashore and rest in
the shade.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better keep on till we get into the
Highlands. We can do it in a quarter of an hour,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>As Tom was pulling the stroke oar, and doing
rather more work than any one else, the others
agreed to row on as long as he would row. They
soon reached the entrance to the Highlands, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
landed at the foot of the great hill called St. Anthony’s
Nose. They were very glad to make the
boat fast to a tree that grew close to the water, and
to clamber a little way up the hill into the shade.</p>

<p>“What will we do to pass away the time till it gets
cooler?” said Harry, after they had rested awhile.</p>

<p>“I can tell you what I’m going to do,” said Tom;
“I’m going to get some of the sleep that I didn’t get
last night, and you’d better follow my example.”</p>

<p>All the boys at once found that they were sleepy;
and, having brought the tent up from the boat, they
spread it on the ground for a bed, and presently were
sleeping soundly. The mosquitoes came and feasted
on them, and the innumerable insects of the summer
woods crawled over them, and explored their necks,
shirt-sleeves, and trousers-legs, as is the pleasant custom
of insects of an inquiring turn of mind.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Harry, suddenly sitting up,
as the sound of a heavy explosion died away in long,
rolling echoes.</p>

<p>“I heard it,” said Joe; “it’s a cannon. The cadets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
up at West Point are firing at a mark with a tremendous
big cannon.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go up and see them,” exclaimed Jim. “It’s
a great deal cooler than it was.”</p>

<p>With the natural eagerness of boys to be in the
neighborhood of a cannon, they made haste to gather
up the tent and carry it to the boat. As they came
out from under the thick trees, they saw that the
sky in the north was as black as midnight, and that
a thunder-storm was close at hand.</p>

<p>“Your cannon, Joe, was a clap of thunder,” said
Harry. “We’re going to get wet again.”</p>

<p>“We needn’t get wet,” said Tom. “If we hurry
up we can get the tent pitched and put the things
in it, so as to keep them dry.”</p>

<p>They worked rapidly, for the rain was approaching
fast, but it was not easy to pitch the tent on a
side hill. It was done, however, after a fashion; and
the blankets and other things that were liable to be
injured by the wet were safely under shelter before
the storm reached them.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_047.jpg" width="75" height="82" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a terrific storm. The wind swept
down the river, raising a ridge of white water
in its path. The rain came down harder, so
the boys thought, than they had ever seen it come
down before, and the glare of the lightning and the
crash of the thunder were frightful.</p>

<p>“What luck it is that we got the tent pitched in
time,” exclaimed Joe. “We’re as dry and comfortable
here as if we were in a house.”</p>

<p>“Pick your blankets up quick, boys,” cried Harry.
“Here’s the water coming in under the tent.”</p>

<p>Joe had boasted a little too soon. The water
running down the side of the hill was making its
way in large quantities into the tent. To save their
clothes and blankets, the boys had to stand up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
hold them in their arms, which was by no means a
pleasant occupation, especially as the cold rain-water
was bathing their feet.</p>

<p>“It can’t last long,” remarked Tom. “We’re all
right if the lightning doesn’t strike us.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the powder?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s in the flask,” replied Joe, “and I’ve got
the flask in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“So, if the lightning strikes the tent, we’ll all be
blown up,” exclaimed Harry. “This is getting more
and more pleasant.”</p>

<p>The boys were not yet at the end of their troubles.
The rain had loosened the earth, and the tent-pins,
of which only four had been used, were no longer fit
to hold the tent. So, while they were talking about
the powder, the tent suddenly blew down, upsetting
the boys as it fell, and burying them under the wet
canvas.</p>

<p>“Lie still, fellows,” said Tom, as the other boys
tried to wriggle out from under the tent. “We’ve
got to get wet now, anyway; but perhaps, if we stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
as we are, we can manage to keep the blankets
dry.”</p>

<p>The wet tent felt miserably cold as it clung to
their heads and shoulders, but the boys kept under
it, and held their blankets and spare shirts wrapped
tightly in their arms. Luckily the storm was nearly
at an end when the tent blew down, and a few
moments later the rain ceased, and the crew of the
<i>Whitewing</i>, in a very damp condition, crept out and
congratulated themselves that they had escaped with
no worse injury than a wet skin.</p>

<p>“Where are your rubber blankets?” asked Harry,
presently.</p>

<p>“Rolled up with the other blankets,” answered
everybody.</p>

<p>“It won’t do to tell when we get home,” remarked
Harry, “that, instead of using the water-proof blankets
to keep ourselves dry, we used ourselves to keep
the water-proofs dry. It’s the most stupid thing
we’ve done yet; and I’m as bad as anybody else.”</p>

<p>“It was a good deal worse to pitch a tent without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
digging a trench around it,” said Tom. “If I’d dug
a trench two inches deep just back of that tent, not
a drop of water would have run into it.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t think much of the plan of using only
four pins to hold a tent down when a hurricane is
coming on,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“And I think the least said by a fellow who carries
two pounds of powder in his pocket in a thunder-storm
the better,” added Jim.</p>

<p>It took some time to bale the water out of the
boat, for the rain and the spray from the river had
half-filled it. But the shower had cooled the air,
and the boys were glad to be at work again after
their confinement in the tent. They were soon
ready to start; and, rowing easily and steadily, they
passed through the Highlands, and reached a nice
camping spot on the east bank of the river below
Poughkeepsie, before half-past five.</p>

<p>This time they selected a place to pitch the tent
with great care. It was easy to find the high-water
mark on the shore, and the tent was pitched a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
above it, so as to be safe from a disaster like that of
the previous night. Harry wanted it pitched on the
top of a high bank; but the others insisted that, as
long as they were safe from the tide, there was no
need of putting the tent a long distance from the
water, and that they had selected the only spot
where they could have a bed of sand to sleep on.</p>

<p>This important business being settled, supper was
the next subject of attention.</p>

<p>“We haven’t been as regular about our meals as
we ought to be,” said Harry, “but it hasn’t been our
fault. We’ll have a good supper to-night, at any
rate. How would you like some hot turtle-soup?”</p>

<p>“Just the thing,” said Joe. “The bread is beginning
to get a little dry; but we can soak it in the
soup.”</p>

<p>“About going for milk,” continued Harry; “we
ought to arrange that and the other regular duties.
Suppose after this we take regular turns. One fellow
can pitch the tent, another can go for milk, another
can get the firewood, and the other can cook.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
We can arrange it according to alphabetical order.
For instance, Tom Schuyler pitches the tent to-night;
Jim Sharpe goes for milk, Joe gets the firewood, and
I cook. The next time we camp, Jim will pitch the
tent, Joe will get the milk, I will get the wood, and
Tom will cook. Is that fair?”</p>

<p>The boys said it was, and they agreed to adopt
Harry’s proposal. Jim went off with the milk-pail,
and when the fire was ready, Harry took a can of
soup and put it on the coals to be heated.</p>

<p>Jim found a house quite near at hand, where he
bought two quarts of milk and a loaf of bread, and
was back again at the camp before the soup was
ready. He found the boys lying near the fire, waiting
for the soup to heat and the coffee to boil.</p>

<p>“That soup takes a long time to heat through,”
said Tom. “There isn’t a bit of steam coming out of
it yet.”</p>

<p>“How can any steam come out of it when it’s soldered
up tight,” replied Harry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="53a"><img src="images/i_052b.jpg" alt="THE SOUP EXPLOSION" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE SOUP EXPLOSION.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“You don’t mean to tell me that you’ve put the
can on the fire without punching a hole in the
top?”</p>

<p>“Of course I have. What on earth should I
punch a hole in it for?”</p>

<p>“Because—” cried Tom, hastily springing up.</p>

<p>But he was interrupted by a report like that of a
small cannon: a cloud of ashes rose over the fire,
and a shower of soup fell just where Tom had been
lying.</p>

<p>“That’s the reason why,” resumed Tom. “The
steam has burst the can, and the soup has gone up.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got another can,” said Harry, “and we’ll
punch a hole in that one. What an idiot I was not
to think of its bursting! It’s a good job that it
didn’t hurt us. I should hate to have the newspapers
say that we had been blown up and awfully
mangled with soup.”</p>

<p>The other can of soup was safely heated, and the
boys made a comfortable supper. They drove a
stake in the sand, and fastened the boat’s painter securely
to it, and then “turned in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“No tide to rouse us up to-night, boys,” said Harry,
as he rolled himself in his blanket. “I sha’n’t
wake up till daylight.”</p>

<p>“We’d better take an early start,” remarked Tom.
“We haven’t got on very far because we started so
late this morning. If we get off by six every morning,
we can lie off in the middle of the day, and start
again about three o’clock. It’s no fun rowing with
the sun right overhead.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t more than eight o’clock now; and,
if we take eight hours’ sleep, we can turn out at four
o’clock,” said Harry. “But who is going to wake
us up? Joe and Jim are sound asleep already, and
I’m awful sleepy myself. I don’t believe one of us
will wake up before seven o’clock anyway.”</p>

<p>Tom made no answer, for he had dropped asleep
while Harry was talking. The latter thought he
must be pretending to sleep, and was just resolving
to tell Tom that it wasn’t very polite to refuse to answer
a civil question, when he found himself muttering
something about a game of base-ball, and awoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
with a start, to discover that he could not possibly
keep awake another moment.</p>

<p>The boys slept on. The moon came out and
shone in at the open tent-flap, and the tide rose to
high-water mark, but not quite high enough to reach
the tent. By-and-by the wheezing of a tow-boat
broke the stillness, and occasionally a hoarse steam-whistle
echoed among the hills; but the boys slept
so soundly that they would not have heard a locomotive
had it whistled its worst within a rod of
the tent.</p>

<p>The river had been like a mill-pond since the
thunder-storm, but about midnight a heavy swell
rolled in toward the shore. It came on, growing
larger and larger, and, rushing up the little beach
with a fierce roar, dashed into the tent and overwhelmed
the sleeping boys without the slightest
warning.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE wave receded as suddenly as it came.
The boys sprang up in a terrible fright, and
indeed there are few men who in their place
would not have been frightened. The shock of
the cold water was enough to startle the strongest
nerves, and as the boys rushed to the door of the
tent, in a blind race for life, they fully believed that
their last hour had come. Before they could get
out of the tent, a second wave swept up and rose
above their knees. With wild cries of terror the
two younger boys caught hold of Tom, and, losing
their footing, dragged him down. Harry caught at
Tom impulsively, with a vague idea of saving him
from drowning, but the only result of his effort was
that he went down with the rest. Fortunately the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
wave receded before the boys had time to drown,
and left them struggling in a heap on the wet sand.
There was no return of the water, and in a few moments
the boys were outside of the tent and on the
top of the bluff above the river.</p>

<p>“It must have been a tidal wave,” said Jim. “Oh,
I’d give anything if I was home! The water will
come up again, and we’ll all be drowned!”</p>

<p>“It was the swell of a steamboat,” said Tom.
“There’s the boat now, just going around that
point.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Harry. “It was nothing but
the swell of the night-boat. What precious fools we
were not to think of it before! To-morrow night
we’ll pitch the tent about a thousand feet above the
water.”</p>

<p>“Then there’ll be a water-spout or something,”
said Jim. “We’re bound to get wet whatever we
do. We only started yesterday, and here we’ve
been wet through three times.”</p>

<p>“And Harry has been wet four times, counting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the time he jumped in the Harlem for me,” added
Joe.</p>

<p>“It won’t do to stand here and talk about it,” said
Tom. “We’ve got to have a fire or we’ll freeze to
death. Look at the way Joe’s teeth are chattering.
The blankets and clothes are all wet, and the sooner
we dry them the sooner we’ll get warm.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="58a"><img src="images/i_058a.jpg" alt="THE BOYS BUILT A ROARING FIRE ON A LARGE FLAT ROCK" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE BOYS BUILT A ROARING FIRE ON A LARGE FLAT ROCK.</p>

<p>There happened to be a dead tree near by, and it
was soon converted into firewood. The boys built
a roaring fire on a large flat rock, and after it had
burnt for a little while they pushed it about six
feet from the place where they had started it, and,
after piling fresh fuel on it, laid down on the hot
rock with their feet to the flames. The fire had
heated the rock so that they could hardly bear to
touch it, but the heat dried their wet clothes rapidly,
and kept them from taking severe colds. Meanwhile
their blankets had been spread out near the fire,
and in half an hour were very nearly dry, and pretty
severely scorched. Two large logs were then rolled
on the fire, and when they were in a blaze the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
boys wrapped themselves in their blankets, and,
lying as near to the fire as they could without
actually burning, resumed their interrupted sleep.
They found the rock rather a hard bed, and it offered
no temptation to laziness; so it happened that
they were all broad awake at half-past four; and
though somewhat stiff from lying on a rocky bed,
were none the worse for their night’s adventure.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I’m going to do this very day,”
said Harry, as they were dressing themselves after
their morning swim. “I’m going to write to the
Department to send us a big rubber bag, that we
can put our spare clothes in and keep them dry.
There’s no fun in being wet and having nothing dry
to put on.”</p>

<p>“If we have the bag sent to Albany, it will get
there by the time we do,” said Tom. “You write
the letter while we are getting breakfast.”</p>

<p>So Harry wrote to the Department as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Uncle John</span>,—We’ve been wet through with a steamboat
once, and the tide wet us the first night, and we got rained on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and I jumped in to get Joe out, and we’ve had a gorgeous time.
Please send us a big water-proof bag to put our spare clothes in, so
that we can have something dry. Please send it to Albany, and
we will stop there at the post-office for it. Please send it right
away. You said the Department furnished everything. We’ve
been dry twice since we started, but it didn’t last long. There never
was such fun. All the boys send their love to you. Please
don’t forget the bag. From your affectionate nephew,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Harry</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“This was the morning that you were going to
sleep till eight o’clock without waking up, Harry,”
said Tom, as they were eating their breakfast.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing that will wake a fellow up so
quick as the Hudson River rolling in on him. I
hadn’t expected to wake up in that way,” answered
Harry.</p>

<p>“So far we have done nothing but find out how
stupid we are,” said Tom. “Seems to me we must
have found it pretty near all out by this time.
There can’t be many more stupid things that we
haven’t done.”</p>

<p>“There won’t any accident happen to-night,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Harry; “for I’ll make sure that the tent is
pitched so far from the water that we can’t be wet
again. I wonder if every fellow learns to camp out
by getting into scrapes as we do. It is very certain
that we won’t forget what we learn on this cruise.”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to get tired of ham,” exclaimed
Joe. “We’ve been eating ham ever since we started.
Let’s get some eggs to-day.”</p>

<p>“And some raspberries,” suggested Jim. “It’s
the season for them.”</p>

<p>“And let’s catch some fish,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll do,” said Harry. “We’ll sail
till eleven o’clock, and then we’ll go fishing and
catch our dinner.”</p>

<p>This suggestion pleased everybody; and when, at
about six o’clock, they set sail with a nice breeze
from the south, everybody kept a lookout for a
good fishing-ground, and wondered why they had
not thought of fishing before.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_007.jpg" width="75" height="72" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sun was getting to be rather too hot for
boating when the boys saw the half-sunken
wreck of a canal-boat close to the west shore,
where there was a nice shady grove. They immediately
crossed the river, and, landing near the wreck,
began to get their fishing-tackle in order.</p>

<p>As there were only two poles, one of which belonged
to Harry, and the other to Tom, the two
Sharpe boys were obliged either to cut poles for
themselves, or to watch the others while they fished.
Jim cut a pole for himself, but Joe preferred to lie
on the bank. “I don’t care to fish, anyhow,” he said.
“I’ll agree to eat twice as much fish as anybody else,
if I can be excused from fishing.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to fish, you’d better hunt bait
for us,” said Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“I never thought about bait,” exclaimed Harry.
“How are we going to dig for worms without a
spade?”</p>

<p>“Who wants any worms?” replied Tom. “Grasshoppers
are the thing; and the field just back of
here is full of them. Come, Joe, catch us some grasshoppers,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“How many do you want?” asked Joe. “I don’t
want to waste good grasshoppers on fellows who
won’t use them. Let’s see: suppose I get you ten
grasshoppers apiece. Will that do?”</p>

<p>“Are you getting lazy, Joe?” said Tom, “or are
you sick? A fellow who don’t want to fish must
have something wrong in his insides. Harry, you’d
better give him some medicine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right,” replied Joe. “I’m a little
sleepy to-day, but I’ll get your grasshoppers.”</p>

<p>Joe took an empty tin can and went in search of
grasshoppers, while the rest were getting their hooks
and lines ready. In a short time he returned, and
handed the can to Tom. “There’s just thirty-one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
grasshoppers in that can,” said he. “I threw in one
for good measure. Now go ahead and fish, and I’ll
have a nap.” So saying, he stretched himself on the
ground, and the other boys began to fish.</p>

<p>There were quantities of perch near the old canal-boat,
and they bit ravenously at the grasshoppers.
It took only about a quarter of an hour to catch
nearly three dozen fish. These were more than the
boys could possibly eat; and Tom was just going to
remark that they had better stop fishing, when they
were startled by a loud cry from Joe. Harry, in
swinging his line over his head so as to cast out a
long way into the river, had succeeded in hooking
Joe in the right ear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="64a"><img src="images/i_064a.jpg" alt="JOE IS CAUGHT" /></div>
<p class="caption">JOE IS CAUGHT.</p>

<p>Of course Harry was extremely sorry, and he said
so several times; but, as Joe pointed out, “talk won’t
pull a hook out of a fellow’s ear!” The barb made it
impracticable to draw the hook out, and it was quite
impossible that Joe should enjoy the cruise with a
fish-hook in his ear. Jim said that the hook must
be cut out; but Joe objected to having his ear cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
to pieces with a dull jack-knife. In this emergency
Tom proposed to break off the shank of the hook,
and then to push the remainder of it through the
ear. It was no easy matter, however, to break the
steel. Every time the hook was touched, Joe
winced with pain; but finally Tom managed to
break the shank with the aid of the pair of pliers
that formed part of the stores. The hook was then
gently and firmly pressed through the ear, and carefully
drawn out.</p>

<p>“I knew,” said Tom, “that something must be
wrong when Joe said he didn’t want to fish. This
ought to be a warning to him.”</p>

<p>“It’s a warning to me,” said Harry, “not to
throw my line all over the State of New York.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right now,” said Joe. “Only the
next time I go cruising with Harry, I’m going to
take a pair of cutting pincers to cut off the shanks
of fish-hooks after he gets through fishing. We’d
better get a pair at Hudson, anyhow, or else we’ll all
be stuck full of hooks, if Harry does any more fishing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Harry was so humbled by the result of his carelessness
that he offered, by way of penance, to clean
and cook the fish. When this was done, and the
fish were served up smoking hot, they were so good
that Joe forgot his damaged ear, and Harry recovered
his spirits. After a course of fish and bread, a
can of peaches was opened for dessert, and then followed
a good long rest. By three o’clock the heat
began to lessen, and the <i>Whitewing</i> started on her
way with a better breeze than she had yet been favored
with.</p>

<p>The boat travelled swiftly, and the breeze gradually
freshened. The whitecaps were beginning to
make their appearance on the river before it occurred
to the boys that they must cross over to the east
shore, in order to camp where they could find shade
while getting breakfast the next morning. It had
been one of Uncle John’s most earnest bits of advice
that they should always have shade in the morning.
“Nothing spoils the temper,” he had said, “like cooking
under a bright sun; so make sure that you keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
in the shade until after breakfast.” Harry felt a little
nervous about crossing the river in so fresh a
breeze, since, as the breeze blew from the south, the
boat could not sail directly across the river without
bringing the sea on her beam. He did not mention
that he was nervous, however, and he showed excellent
judgment in crossing the river diagonally, so as
to avoid exposing the broadside of the boat to the
waves, that by this time were unpleasantly high.
The east bank was thus reached without taking a
drop of water into the boat, and she was then kept
on her course up the river, within a few rods of the
shore.</p>

<p>This was a wise precaution in one respect; for, if
the boat had capsized, the boys could easily have
swum ashore; but still it is always risky to keep
close to the shore, unless you know that there are no
rocks or snags in the way. Harry never thought
of the danger of being shipwrecked with the shore
so close at hand, and was enjoying the cooling breeze
and the speed of the boat, when suddenly the <i>Whitewing</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
brought up with a crash that pitched everybody
into the bottom of the boat. She had struck
a sunken rock, and the speed at which she was going
was so great that one of her planks was stove in.
Before the boys could pick themselves up, the water
had rushed in, and was rising rapidly. “Jump overboard,
everybody!” cried Harry. “She won’t float
with us in her.” There was no time in which to
pull off shirts and trousers, and the boys plunged
overboard without even taking their hats off. They
then took hold of the boat, two on each side of her,
and swam toward the shore. With so much water
in her, the boat was tremendously heavy; but the
boys persevered, and finally reached shallow water,
where they could wade and drag her out on the sand.</p>

<p>“Here we are wet again!” exclaimed Jim. “The
blankets are wet, too, this time.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied Tom. “It’s not more
than five o’clock, and we can get them dry before
night.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to work pretty fast, then,” said Harry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
“Jim and Joe had better build a big fire and
dry the things, while you and I empty the boat; or
I’ll empty the boat, and you can pitch the tent.
We’ll have to put off supper till we can make sure
of a dry bed.”</p>

<p>Harry took the things out of the boat one by one.
Everything was wet except the contents of the tin
boxes, into which the water luckily had not penetrated.
As soon as the fire was built, Jim and Joe
gave their whole attention to drying the blankets
and the spare clothing; and when the boat was emptied,
it was found that a hole nearly six inches long
and four inches wide had been made through one
of the bottom planks. Harry and Tom set to work
to mend it. They took a piece of canvas—which
had luckily been kept in one of the tin boxes and
was quite dry—and tacked it neatly over the outside
of the hole. They next covered the canvas with
a thin coating of white-lead, except at the edges,
where the white-lead was laid on very thickly.
Over the canvas the piece of zinc that had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
brought for just such a purpose was carefully tacked,
and then thin strips of wood were placed over
the edges of the tin, and screwed down tightly with
screws that went through the zinc, but not through
the canvas. Finally, white-lead was put all around
the outer edge of the zinc, and the boat was then
left bottom-side up on the sand, so that the white-lead
could harden by exposure to the air.</p>

<p>Nobody cared to go for milk in wet clothes; and
so, when the boat was mended, the boys all sat
around the fire to dry themselves, and made a supper
of crackers. What with the heat and the wind,
it was not very long before their clothes and blankets
were thoroughly dried; and they could look forward
to a comfortable night. The tent was pitched
where no steamboat swell could possibly touch it,
and the boat was apparently out of reach of the tide.
It was very early when the boys “turned in,” and
for the first time in the cruise they slept peacefully
all night.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_007.jpg" width="75" height="72" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning the boys awoke early,
having had a thoroughly good night’s rest.
Tom, whose turn it was to go for milk, found
a well-stocked farm-house, where he obtained not
only milk, bread, and eggs, but a supply of butter
and a chicken all ready for cooking. After breakfast
the boat was put in the water, and, to the delight
of all, proved to be almost as tight as she was
before running into the rock. A little water came
in at first under the edges of the zinc, but in a short
time the wood swelled, and the leak entirely ceased.</p>

<p>The boat was loaded, and the boys were ready to
start soon after six o’clock. There was no wind, but
the two long oars, pulled one by Tom and the other
by Jim, sent her along at a fine rate. They rowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
until ten o’clock, resting occasionally for a few moments,
and then, as there were no signs of a breeze,
and as it was growing excessively hot, they went
ashore, to wait until afternoon before resuming their
journey.</p>

<p>The sun became hotter and hotter. The boys
tried to fish, but there was no shade near the bank
of the river, and it was too hot to stand or sit in
the sunshine and wait for fish to bite. They went
in swimming, but the sun, beating on their heads,
seemed hotter while they were in the water than it
did when they were on the land. Jim and Joe tried
a game of mumble-to-peg, but they gave it up long
before they had reached “ears.” It was probably the
hottest day of the year; and as it was clearly impossible
to row or to do anything else while the heat
lasted, the boys brought their blankets from the
boat, and, going to a grove not far from the shore, lay
down and fell asleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="72a"><img src="images/i_072a.jpg" alt="MUMBLE-THE-PEG" /></div>
<p class="caption">MUMBLE-THE-PEG.</p>

<p>They were astonished to find, when they awoke,
that it was two o’clock. None of them had been accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
to sleep in the daytime, and they could not
understand how it came about that they had all slept
for fully two hours. They had yet to learn that one
of the results of “camping out,” or living in the
open air, is an ability to sleep at almost any time.
All animals and wild creatures, whether they are
beasts or savages, have this happy faculty of sleeping
in the daytime. It is one of the habits of our
savage ancestors that comes back to us when we
abandon civilization, and live as Aryan tribes, from
whom we are descended, lived in the Far East, before
they marched with their wives and children and cattle
from India, and made themselves new homes in
Europe.</p>

<p>After lunch the boys prepared to start, although
there was still no wind; but when they went down
to the boat they found that the sun was as hot as
ever. So they returned to the shade of the grove,
and made up their minds to stay there until the end
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Harry,” said Tom, “we’ve been on the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
three days, and we are only a little way above Hudson.
How much longer will it be before we get to
Albany?”</p>

<p>“We ought to get there in two days more, even
if we have to row all the way,” replied Harry.</p>

<p>“And after we get to Albany, what are we to do
next?”</p>

<p>“We are going up the Champlain Canal to Fort
Edward. There we will have a wagon to carry us
and the boat to Warrensburg, on the Schroon River,
and will go up the river to Schroon Lake. Uncle
John laid out the route for us.”</p>

<p>“How many days will it take us to get to the
lake?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>Harry thought awhile. “There’s two days more
on the Hudson, two on the canal, and maybe two
on the Schroon River. And then there’s a Sunday,
which don’t count. It’ll be just a week before we
get to the lake.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be home by two weeks from next
Monday,” continued Tom, “so I sha’n’t have much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
time on the lake. Can’t we get along a little faster?
There’s a full-moon to-night, and suppose we sail all
night—or row, if the wind doesn’t come up.”</p>

<p>“That’s a first-rate idea,” exclaimed Harry. “We
can take turns sleeping in the bottom of the boat.
Why, if the breeze comes up in the night, we might
make twenty or thirty miles before morning.”</p>

<p>All the boys liked the plan of sailing at night,
and they resolved to adopt it. While they were yet
discussing it, a light breeze sprang up, from the
south as usual, and they hastened to take advantage
of it. In the course of an hour more the sun began
to lose its power; and when they went ashore at six
o’clock to cook their supper, they had sailed about
fifteen miles.</p>

<p>As they expected to make so much progress during
the night, they were in no hurry about supper,
and it was not until after seven o’clock that they
again made sail. Harry divided the crew into
watches—one consisting of himself and Joe Sharpe,
and the other of Tom and Jim. Each watch was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
have charge of the boat for three hours, while the
other watch slept. At eight o’clock Tom and Jim
lay down in the bottom of the boat, and Joe came
aft to take Tom’s customary place at the sheet.
Harry, of course, steered.</p>

<p>All went well. The breeze was light but steady,
and Harry kept the boat in the middle of the river
to avoid another shipwreck. The watch below did
not sleep much, for they had had a long nap at
noon, and, besides, the novelty of their position made
them wakeful. They had just dropped asleep when
eleven o’clock arrived, and they were awakened to
relieve the other watch. Tom went sleepily to the
helm, and Harry and Joe gladly “turned in,” and
were soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Tom always declares that he never closed his eyes
while he was at the helm, and Jim also asserts that
he was wide awake during his entire watch, though
neither he nor Tom spoke for fear of waking up the
other boys. It was strange that these two wide-awake
young Moral Pirates did not notice that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
large steamboat—one of the Albany night-boats—was
in sight, until she was within a mile of them,
and it is just possible that, without knowing it, they
were a little too drowsy to keep a proper lookout.</p>

<p>As soon as Tom saw the steamboat, he remarked,
“Halloo! there’s one of the Albany boats,” and
steered the boat over toward the east shore. The
breeze had nearly died away, and the <i>Whitewing</i>
moved very slowly. The steamboat came rapidly
down the river, her paddles throbbing loudly in the
night air. Jim began to get a little uneasy, and
said, “I hope she won’t run us down.” “Oh, there’s
no danger!” replied Tom; “we shall get out of her
way easy enough.” But, to his dismay, the steamboat,
instead of keeping in the middle of the river,
presently turned toward the east shore, as if she were
bent upon running down the <i>Whitewing</i>. Tom was
now really alarmed; and as he saw that the sail was
doing very little good, he hurriedly told Jim to take
down the mast and get out the oars as quick as
possible. Jim rapidly obeyed the order, dropping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the mast on Harry’s head, and catching Joe by the
nose in his search for the oars. By this time Tom
had begun to hail the steamboat at the top of his
lungs; but no attention was paid to him by the
steamboat men, since the noise of the paddles drowned
Tom’s voice. Harry and Joe, who were now
wide awake, saw what danger they were in, and they
sprang to the oars. The steamboat was frightfully
near, and still hugging the shore; but Tom called
on the boys to give way with their oars, and steered
straight for the shore, knowing that there must be
room for the boat between the steamboat and the
bank of the river, and fearing that if he steered in
the opposite direction the steamboat might change
her course and run them down, when they would
have little chance of escape by swimming.</p>

<p>It was certainly very doubtful if they could avoid
the steamboat, and Tom was well aware of it. He
told the other boys that, if they were sure to be run
down, they must jump before the steamboat struck
them, and dive, so as to escape the paddles. “I’ll tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
you when to jump, if worst comes to worst,” said he;
“but don’t you look around now, nor do anything but
row. Row for your lives, boys.” And the boys did
row gallantly. Harry had a pair of sculls, and Jim
had a long oar, and between them they made the
boat fly through the water. As they neared the
shore, it seemed to them that there was not more
than three feet of space between the steamboat and
the land; and Tom had almost made up his mind
that the cruise was coming to a sudden end, when the
great steamboat swung her head around, and drew out
toward the middle of the river. She did not seem
to be more than a rod from them as she changed
her course, though in reality she was probably much
farther off. At the same moment the <i>Whitewing</i>
reached what appeared to be the shore, but what
was really a long row of piles projecting about a
foot above the water. The boys had just ceased
rowing, and Tom had given the boat a sheer with
the rudder, so as to bring her along-side of the piles,
when the steamboat’s swell, which the boys, in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
excitement over their narrow escape, had totally forgotten,
came rushing up, seized the boat, and threw
it over the piles into a shallow and muddy lagoon.</p>

<p>It was almost miraculous that the boat was not
capsized; but she was actually lifted up and thrown
over the piles, without taking more than a few quarts
of spray into her. When they saw that they were
absolutely safe, the boys began to wonder how in
the world they could get the boat back into the
river, and Jim proposed to light the lantern and see
if anything was missing out of the boat, and if she
had been injured.</p>

<p>“Now I see why the steamboat did not notice us,”
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked all the others together.</p>

<p>“Because,” he replied, “we have been such everlasting
idiots as to sail at night without showing a
light.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE boat was in a shallow part of the river,
between the shore and a long row of piles
that marked the steamboat channel. Harry
sounded with an oar, and found that the water was
only two feet deep. “We’ll have to get overboard
and drag the boat over the piles,” said he, “and it’s
going to be a mighty hard job, too. That swell
threw us over as neat as the bull threw Joe over
the fence up at Lenox last summer.”</p>

<p>“When I got pitched over that fence I stayed
there,” said Joe. “I didn’t try to get back into the
field where the bull was, and I don’t see what we
want to get back where the steamboats are for.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” exclaimed Harry. “We’re safe
enough here. Let’s get the water out of the boat,
and keep on this side of the piles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>When the boat was made dry, and the lighted lantern
was hoisted to the top of the mast, Tom resumed
his place at the helm, and Harry and Joe prepared
to take another nap. “I don’t want to grumble,”
said Joe, “but I wish I didn’t have to lie on
the coffee-pot and a tin cup. I don’t feel comfortable
on that kind of bed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll change with you if you like,” replied Harry.
“I’m sleeping on a beautiful soft bottle of oil, and
some sardine boxes, but I don’t want to be selfish
and keep the best bed for myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” returned Joe. “I’ll manage to
sleep if Jim don’t step on my face. I always did
hate to have anybody step on my face when I was
asleep.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-night everybody,” said Harry. “I’m
going straight to sleep. Tom, be sure you wake me
up if a steamboat tries to climb over these piles.”</p>

<p>This time Tom did not fall asleep at the helm, but
the wind gradually died away, and the sail hung
limp and useless. Jim got out the oars without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
stepping on anybody, and rowed slowly on. In a
little while they came to the end of the shallow lagoon
into which the swell had so unexpectedly cast
them. A sand-bank stretched from the shore to the
line of piles, and it was impossible to go any farther.
Tom decided to make the boat fast to the limb of a
willow-tree that projected over the water, and to go
ashore and sleep on the sand. Neither he nor Jim
thought it worth while to wake the other boys; so
they gathered up their blankets, crept quietly out of
the boat, and were soon asleep on the soft, warm
sand. When Harry and Joe awoke at daylight,
stiff and cramped, they were disposed to be rather
indignant at Tom and Jim, who were sleeping so
comfortably on the sand; but Tom soon convinced
them that he had acted from the best of motives,
and they readily forgave him.</p>

<p>Of course breakfast was the first business of the
day, and after that was finished the boat had to be
entirely unloaded before she could be lifted over the
piles into the channel. For the first time since they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
had started on the cruise the breeze was ahead, but
it was so light that it was of very little consequence.
The sky was cloudy, and the day promised to be a
cool one; so the boys resolved to take to their oars
and try, if possible, to reach Albany before night.
When the boat was loaded, Tom and Jim each took
a long oar, and Harry took his usual seat in the
stern-sheets. They all felt fresh in spite of their
night’s adventure, and started gayly on their intended
long day’s row.</p>

<p>By this time they had found out that, although
round tin boxes were very well to keep things dry,
they are by no means handy to carry in a boat.
Their shape made it impossible to stow them compactly.
Joe, who sat at the bow, always had to pick
his way over these tin boxes in going to or coming
from his station; and he was constantly catching his
foot in the spaces left between the boxes, and falling
down on them. This smashed in the covers, and
tried Joe’s temper sorely. Once he sat down so violently
on the box which held the sugar, that he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
completely through the cover, and was fastened in
the box as securely as a cork in a bottle. He was
only released after a great deal of work, and just in
time to enable the boys to have sugar in their coffee
at night. Harry resolved that he would never cruise
again with round boxes, but would have small rubber
bags made, in which to put everything that required
to be kept dry.</p>

<p>The boys took turns at the oars every hour, and
rowed steadily until noon. They gave themselves
an hour for lunch and resting, and then resumed
their work. Late in the afternoon they came in
sight of Albany, and went ashore, so as to get their
dinner before reaching the city. After dinner they
again pulled away at the oars, and at about nine
o’clock they stopped at a lumber-yard on the outskirts
of Albany, and, creeping in among the lumber,
wrapped their blankets around them, and dropped
asleep, completely worn out, but proud of their
long day’s row.</p>

<p>Before sunrise the next morning, Tom was awakened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
by a stick which was thrust into his ribs. Without
opening his eyes, he muttered, “You quit that,
or I’ll get up and pound you!” and immediately
dropped asleep again. Somebody then kicked him
so sharply that he roused himself up, and, opening
his eyes, was dazzled by the gleam of a bull’s-eye
lantern. He could not at first imagine where he
was; but, as he presently found that a big policeman
had him by the collar, and was calling him “an impudent
young thief,” he began to imagine that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you this time,” said the policeman, “and
the whole gang of you. Where did you steal that
property in your boat from, you precious young river
pirate?”</p>

<p>“We’re not river pirates,” replied Tom. “We’re
Moral Pirates, and we brought those things in the
boat with us from New York.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like your cheek!” said the officer;
“owning up that you’re pirates. Now just you and
your gang take everything out of that boat and let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
me see what you’ve got. If any of you try to escape,
I’ll put a bullet into you. You hear me?”</p>

<p>The other boys had been awakened by the loud
voice of the policeman, and were staring at him in
utter astonishment.</p>

<p>“He thinks we’re river thieves,” said Tom. “Harry,
we’ll have to show him what we’ve got in the
boat, and then he’ll see his mistake.”</p>

<p>Harry eagerly assured the policeman that they
had come from New York on a pleasure cruise, and
had nothing in the boat except provisions and stores.
“That’s a pretty story,” said the officer. “You can
tell that to the court. Your boat’s full of junk
that you’ve stolen from somewhere; and you’d better
hand it out mighty quick!”</p>

<p>The boys were thus compelled to unload their
boat, while the policeman stood over them with his
club in one hand and his lantern in the other. He
was not a stupid man, and he soon perceived that
the boys had told him the truth; they were not the
gang of river thieves for whom he had mistaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
them. He therefore apologized, in a rough way,
and even helped the boys repack the boat.</p>

<p>“What I can’t understand,” said he, “is why you
boys come here and sleep in a lumber-yard, when
you might be sleeping at home in your beds. Now
if you were thieves, you couldn’t get any better lodgings,
you know; but you’re gentlemen’s sons, and
you ought to know better. Why don’t you go
down to the hotel and live like gentlemen? Where’s
the fun in being arrested, and taking up my valuable
time?”</p>

<p>The boys assured him that they had never enjoyed
themselves more than they had while on the cruise,
and after a little more talk the officer turned slowly
away.</p>

<p>“By-the-bye,” he exclaimed, suddenly turning back
again, “one of you told me you were pirates. I ought
to take you in after all. I believe you’re a lot of
boys that have been reading dime novels, and have
run away from home.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say we were pirates,” replied Tom. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
said we were Moral Pirates. That’s a very different
thing.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” said Joe. “A Moral Pirate is a
sort of missionary, you know. I’m afraid you don’t
go to Sunday-school, officer, or you’d know better.”</p>

<p>The policeman could not quite make up his mind
whether Joe was in joke or in earnest; but as he
could find no real reason for arresting the boys, he
contented himself with telling them to leave the
lumber-yard as soon as the sun rose. “And you’d
better look out,” he added, “that you don’t come
across any real river thieves. They’ll make no bones
of seizing your boat, and knocking you on the head
if you make any noise.” When he was fairly out of
sight, the boys crept back to their shelter among the
lumber, and coolly went to sleep again. They were
so tired that neither policemen nor river thieves had
any terrors for them.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE policeman did not return, and the boys
slept until an hour after sunrise. They then
rowed down the river to the steamboat landing,
where they left their boat in charge of a boatman
and went to a hotel for breakfast. The waiters
were rather astonished at the tremendous appetites
displayed by the four sunburnt boys, and there is no
doubt that the landlord lost money that morning.
After breakfast Harry went to the express office,
where he found a large water-proof India-rubber bag,
which the Department had sent in answer to his letter.
At the post-office were letters from home for
all the boys, and a postal order for ten dollars from
Uncle John for the use of the expedition. Harry
had no idea that this money would be needed, but it
subsequently proved to be very useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Quite a quantity of stores were bought at Albany,
for the voyage up the Hudson had lasted longer
than any one had supposed it would, and the provisions
were getting low. No unnecessary time was
spent in buying these stores, for a fair wind was
blowing, and all the boys were anxious to take advantage
of it. By ten o’clock they were again afloat;
and soon after noon they reached Troy and entered
the canal.</p>

<p>The canal basin was crowded with canal-boats,
and to avoid accidents the <i>Whitewing’s</i> mast was
taken down, and the oars were got out. Harry
knew that, in order to pass through the locks, it
would be necessary to pay toll, and to procure an
order from the canal authorities directing the lockmen
to permit the <i>Whitewing</i> to pass. The canal-boatmen, of
whom he made inquiries, told him where
to find the office, which was some little distance up
the canal. When the office was reached, an officer
came and inspected the boat, asked a great many
questions about the cruise up the Hudson, and seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to be very much interested in the expedition. He
told the boys that the water was low in the Champlain
Canal, and that the lockmen might not be willing
to open the locks for so small a boat; but that
they could avoid all dispute by entering the locks at
the same time with some one of the many canal-boats
that were on their way north. He charged
the <i>Whitewing</i> the enormous sum of twenty-five
cents for tolls, and gave Harry an important-looking
order by which the lockmen were directed to allow
the skiff <i>Whitewing</i>, Captain Harry Wilson, to pass
through all the locks on the canal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="93a"><img src="images/i_092b.jpg" alt="GOING THROUGH THE LOCK" /></div>
<p class="caption">GOING THROUGH THE LOCK.</p>

<p>Thanking the pleasant officer, the boys pushed off.
After they had passed the place where the Champlain
Canal branches off from the Erie Canal, they
were no longer troubled by a crowd of canal-boats,
and were able to set the sail again. Unluckily, the
mast was just a little too high to pass under the
bridges, and at the first bridge which they met they
narrowly escaped a capsize—Jim succeeding in getting
the mast down only just in time to save it from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
striking the bridge. They had hardly set sail again
when another bridge came in sight, and they could
see just beyond it a third bridge. It would never
do to stop at every bridge and unship the mast; so
Harry went on shore, borrowed a saw from a cooper’s
shop, and sawed six inches off from the top of
the mast, after which the bridges gave them no more
trouble.</p>

<p>The boys were very much interested in passing
the first lock. They slipped into the lock behind a
big canal-boat, which left just room enough between
its rudder and the gate for the <i>Whitewing</i>. When
the lockmen shut the gate behind the boat, and opened
the sluices in the upper gate, the water rose slowly
and steadily. The sides of the lock were so steep
and black that the boys felt very much as if they
were at the bottom of a well; but it was not many
minutes before the water had risen so high that the
upper gates were opened, and the big canal-boat and
its little follower were released.</p>

<p>Passing through a lock in a small boat, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
company with a canal-boat, is not a perfectly safe
thing to do; for if the ropes which fasten the canal-boat
should break—which they sometimes do—the
water rushing in through the sluices would force the
canal-boat against the lower gate, and crush the small
boat like an egg-shell. It is therefore best always
to pass through a lock alone, or in company with
other small boats. The danger, however, is in reality
very slight, and very few accidents occur in canal
locks.</p>

<p>The wind died away before sunset; and the boys
having had only a light lunch, which they ate on
the boat, were glad to go ashore for supper. They
bought some corn from a farmer, and roasted it before
the fire, while some nice slices of ham were frying,
and the coffee-pot was boiling, and so prepared a
supper which they greatly enjoyed. The moon came
up before they had finished the meal, and they felt
strongly tempted to make another attempt at night-work.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we can do,” exclaimed Harry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
“Instead of rowing, let’s tow the boat. One fellow
can tow while another steers, and the rest can sleep
in the boat.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joe. “I’m willing to be a mule.
Only I’d like to know where my harness is coming
from.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got rope enough for that,” replied Harry.
“I’ll take the first turn, and tow for an hour, while
Joe steers; then I’ll steer for an hour, while Joe
tows. Then the other watch will take charge of the
boat for two hours, and Joe and I will sleep.”</p>

<p>“If I’m to sleep on the bottom of that boat,” said
Joe, “I want some nice sharp stones to sleep on. I’m
tired of sleeping on coffee-pots, and want a change.”</p>

<p>A long tow-line was soon rigged on Harry’s shoulders
in such a way that it did not chafe him; a
space in the bottom of the boat was cleared of coffee-pots
and other uncomfortable articles, and a pair of
blankets was spread on the bottom board, so as to
make a comfortable bed, which Tom and Jim hastened
to occupy. Joe took the yoke-lines in his hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
and called to Harry to go ahead. When Harry first
tugged at the tow-line, the boat seemed very heavy;
but as soon as she was in motion, Harry found that
he could tow her as fast as he could walk, and without
any difficulty.</p>

<p>Had the locks been open and the canal-boats been
out of the way, the experiment of towing the <i>Whitewing</i>
at night would have been very successful. As
it happened, the locks were kept closed during the
night, because the water was low; and the canal-boats,
not being able to pass the locks, were moored
to the tow-path. These boats gave Harry and Joe
a great deal of trouble. When one of them was
met, Harry had to unharness himself and toss the
rope into the boat, and Joe had to get out an oar
and scull around the obstacle. This happened so
often that Tom and Jim got very little sleep; and
long before it was time for them to resume duty, a
lock was reached, and Harry had to call all hands
to drag the boat around it.</p>

<p>This was a hard piece of work. First, all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
heavy things had to be taken out of the boat and
carried around the lock. Then the boat had to
be dragged out of the canal on to the tow-path;
hauled up a steep ascent, and launched above the
upper gate. It took a good half-hour to pass the
first of these closed locks, and when the boat was
again ready to start, it was time to change the watch.</p>

<p>Tom and Jim had managed to get only a few minutes’
sleep, but Harry and Joe could not sleep a single
wink. They had not “turned in” for more than
ten minutes, when another lock was reached. This
involved a second half-hour of hard work by all
hands, and twenty minutes later three more locks
close together blocked the way. It was foolish to
persevere in dragging the boat around locks all
night long; so, after getting her out of the canal on
the side opposite to the tow-path, the boys dragged
her behind some bushes, where the canal-boatmen
could not see her at daylight. They then spread their
rubber blankets on the ground, and prepared to sleep
through the remaining four or five hours of darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Boys,” said Joe, suddenly, “does it hurt a fat
woman to jump on her?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” answered Harry. “What do you
ask for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” said Joe. “Only when I was
jumping from one canal-boat to another while I was
a mule, I landed awfully heavy on a fat woman who
was sleeping on deck.”</p>

<p>“What did she do?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“She didn’t do anything. She just said ‘Go
way wid you now, Pathrick,’ as if she was half
asleep and dreaming. Pathrick must be in the
habit of jumping on her.”</p>

<p>“Well, if she likes it, that’s her business, not
yours,” suggested Harry. “Go to sleep, do!”</p>

<p>“I am going to sleep; but I don’t think we ought
to spend our nights in getting run down by steamboats
and jumping on strange fat women. I’m sure
it isn’t right. There, you needn’t throw any more
shoes at me! I won’t say another word.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BOYS,” said Tom, as he was kindling the
fire the next morning, “do you know what
day it is?”</p>

<p>“Saturday, of course,” replied the others.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong; it’s Sunday.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be,” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“But it is,” persisted Tom. “Last night was
the sixth night that we’ve slept out-doors, and we
started on a Monday.”</p>

<p>Tom was right; but it was some time before his
companions could convince themselves that it was
actually Sunday. When they finally admitted that
it was Sunday morning, they gave up the idea of
proceeding up the canal, and began to discuss what
they had better do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>The boat, which had been drawn out of the water
the night before, was concealed by a clump of bushes
from the canal-boatmen. The boys decided to leave
it where it was, and to carry the tent and most of
their baggage to a grove a quarter of a mile distant,
where they could pass a quiet Sunday. The locks
were not yet opened, and no canal-boats were stirring,
and the boys made their way to the grove at
once while their movements were unobserved. They
were afraid that if they attracted the attention of
the boatmen to the clump of bushes some one would
steal the <i>Whitewing</i> while her crew were absent.
They had already seen enough of the “canalers” to
know that they were a wild and lawless set of men,
and they were not anxious to put the temptation of
stealing a nice boat in their way.</p>

<p>The grove was a delightful place; and when they
had pitched the tent under the shadow of the great
oak-trees, they were glad of the prospect of a good
day’s rest. Tom and Harry walked nearly a mile to
church in the morning, leaving the Sharpe boys to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
look after the camp, and they all slept most of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>About dusk, as the fire for cooking supper was
blazing briskly, Joe returned from a foraging expedition,
quite out of breath, and with his milk-pail
half empty. He said that he had met three tramps
on the road, which passed through the grove not
very far from the camp, and that they had snatched
a pie from him that he had bought at a farm-house,
and had chased him for some distance.</p>

<p>He had been badly frightened, as he frankly admitted;
but the other boys thought that it was a good
joke on him. They told him that the tramps would
track him by the milk that he had spilt, and would
probably attack the camp and scalp him. They
soon forgot the adventure, however, with the exception
of Tom; who, although he said nothing at the
time, poured water on the fire as soon as the supper
was cooked—an act which somewhat astonished the
rest. Soon afterward he went into the tent for a
few moments, and when he returned he was beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to advise Joe not to laugh quite so loud, when
the crackling of branches was heard in the grove,
and three very unpleasant-looking men appeared.</p>

<p>It was fast growing dark, but Joe immediately
recognized them as the tramps who had stolen his
pie. “We’ve come to supper,” said one of them.
“Let’s see what you’ve got. Give us the bill of
fare, sonny, and look sharp about it.”</p>

<p>Tom immediately answered that they had eaten
their supper, and that there was nothing left of it
but some coffee. “If you want the coffee, take it,”
said he. “There isn’t anything else for you.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t a perlite way to treat three gen’lemen
as come a long ways to call on you,” said the tramp.
“We’ll just have to help ourselves, and we’ll begin
by looking into your tent. P’raps you’ve got a
crust of bread there, what’ll save a poor starvin’
workin’-man from dyin’ on the spot!”</p>

<p>Tom hastily stepped before the tent. “You can’t
go into this tent,” he said, very quietly; “and you’d
better leave this camp and go about your business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Just hear him,” said the tramp, addressing his
companions. “As if this yere identical camp wasn’t
our business. Now, boys,” he continued, “you’ve
got money with you, and you’ve got clothes, and one
on you’s got a watch, and you’re goin’ to give ’em to
three honest hard-workin’ men, or else you’re goin’ to
have your nice little throats cut.”</p>

<p>“Here, boys, quick!” cried Tom, rushing into the
tent, where he was followed by the other boys before
the tramps could stop them. “Here, Harry,” he continued,
“take the boat-hook. There’s a hatchet for
you, Jim, and a stick for Joe. Now we’ll see if they
can rob us!” So saying, he stepped outside the tent
with the gun in his hand, followed closely by his little
army.</p>

<p>The ruffians hesitated when they saw the cool
way in which Tom confronted them. So they proposed
a compromise, as they called it. “Look a
here,” said the one who had hitherto been the
spokesman; “we ain’t unreasonable, and we’ll compromise
this yere business. You give us your money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and that chap’s watch, and we’ll let you alone.
That’s what I call a very handsome offer.”</p>

<p>“We won’t give you a thing,” replied Tom; “and
I’ll shoot the first one of you that lays a hand on us.”</p>

<p>The tramps consulted for a moment, and then the
leader, with a frightful oath, ordered Tom to drop
that gun instantly.</p>

<p>Tom never said a word, but he cocked both barrels
and waited, with his eye fixed on the enemy.</p>

<p>Presently the tramps separated a little, the leader
remaining where he had been standing, and the others
moving one to the right and the other to the
left of the boys. They evidently intended to rush
on Tom from three directions at once, and so confuse
him and prevent him from shooting.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the leader and the man on the right,”
whispered Tom to Harry. “You lay for the other
fellow with your boat-hook. I’ve given you fair
warning,” he continued, addressing the ruffians, “and
I’ll fire the minute you try to attack us.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="104a"><img src="images/i_104a.jpg" alt="THE FIGHT WITH THE TRAMPS" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE FIGHT WITH THE TRAMPS.</p>

<p>The boys were standing close together in front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the tent, Tom being a little in advance of the others.
Suddenly the leader of the tramps called out, “Now
then!” and all three made a rush toward Tom. He
fired at the tramp in front of him, hitting him in the
leg and bringing him to the ground; but before he
could fire again, the other two were upon him.</p>

<p>The boys gallantly stood by Tom. Harry attacked
one of the tramps with the boat-hook so fiercely
that the fellow cried out that he was stabbed, and
ran away. Meanwhile Tom was struggling with the
third tramp, who had thrown him down, and was
trying to wrench the gun from him, while Jim and
Joe were hovering around them afraid to strike at
the tramp for fear of hitting Tom. But now Harry,
having driven off his antagonist, flew to the help of
Tom, and seizing the tramp by his hair, and bracing
one knee against his back, dragged him backward to
the ground, and held him there until Tom regained
his feet, and, holding the muzzle of the gun at the
robber’s head, called on him to surrender, which the
fellow gladly did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Get some rope, Jim, and tie him!” cried Tom.
“Hold on to his hair, Harry, and I’ll blow his brains
out if he offers to move.”</p>

<p>The tramp was not at all anxious to part with his
brains, and he remained perfectly quiet while Jim
and Joe tied his feet together, and his hands behind
his back.</p>

<p>“Now you stand over him with the boat-hook,
Harry,” said Tom, “and I’ll see to the other fellow.”</p>

<p>The other fellow was, of course, the man who had
been shot. Tom lighted the lantern, for it was now
quite dark, and found that the ruffian had been shot
in the lower part of his right leg, and had fainted
from loss of blood. Taking a towel, Tom tore it
into strips, and bound up the wound, and by the
time he had finished the patient became conscious
again, and begged Tom not to take him to prison.</p>

<p>Now this was precisely what the boys did not
want to do, as it would probably delay them for
several days, and perhaps put an end to their cruise.
Tom therefore said to the prisoner, whom Harry was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
guarding, that if he would promise to help the
wounded man away, and take him to see a doctor,
he would be released. The tramp gladly accepted
the offer, and Harry unfastened the rope from his
legs and arms, while Tom kept his gun in readiness
to use it at the first sign of treachery. The tramps,
however, had quite enough of fighting, and were
only too anxious to get away. The wounded man
was helped to his feet by his companion, and the
two went slowly off, one half carrying the other, and
both cursing the coward who had run away. As
they hobbled off, Tom called out, “I’m sorry I had to
hurt you, but I couldn’t help it, you know; and if
any of you come back here to-night, you’ll find us
ready for you.”</p>

<p>It was a long time before the boys fell asleep that
night, and Tom was overwhelmed with praise for his
coolness and bravery. Though he felt certain that
the tramps would not return, he proposed that a
sentinel should keep guard outside the tent, offering
to share that duty with Harry, since the other boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
were not familiar with guns. So all night long Tom
and Harry, relieving one another every two hours,
marched up and down in front of the tent, keeping a
sharp watch for robbers, and preparing for a desperate
fight every time they heard the slightest noise.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_007.jpg" width="75" height="72" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THOUGH no tramps appeared during the
night, the sentinels proved to be useful; for
as soon as the day began to dawn, Harry,
who was on sentry duty, called his comrades, and
thus they were enabled to get breakfast early, and
to start before six o’clock. They had to wait half
an hour for the first lock to be opened, but after that
they had no difficulty in passing through the other
locks. They rowed steadily, taking turns at the
oars, and occasionally fastening the boat to the stern
of a canal-boat, which would tow them while they
took a short rest. Early in the afternoon they reached
Fort Edward, where they disembarked; and
Harry and Tom went in search of a team, which
they hired to carry them to Warrensburg, on the
Schroon branch of the Hudson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>When the teamster drove down to the bank of
the canal, Tom and the Sharpe boys began to unload
the boat. Harry stopped them. “There isn’t any
use in taking the things out of the boat,” said he.
“We can draw her out of the canal and put her on
the wagon just as she is.”</p>

<p>“Her stern will dip under when we haul her bow
out,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“No it won’t,” replied Harry.</p>

<p>“Let’s take the things out of the stern-sheets, anyhow,”
urged Tom. “All our shoes are there, and
we can’t afford to lose them.”</p>

<p>“Nothing will happen to them,” answered Harry,
confidently. “It’s my boat, and I’m going to haul
her out with the things in her.”</p>

<p>Tom said no more, but took hold of the bow of
the boat with the others, and they began to pull her
out of the water. As Tom had prophesied, when
she was about half-way out her stern dipped under,
the water poured in, and nearly everything in the
after-part of the boat floated out. The harm was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
done now, so the boys hastily dragged the boat up
the bank, and then began to lament their losses.</p>

<p>There was not a shoe left, except the shoes that
Harry and Tom had put on when they went in
search of the team. The mast and sail and two oars
were floating on the water, and a quantity of small
articles, including the tin frying-pans and a tin pail,
had shared the fate of the shoes, and were lying at
the bottom of the canal.</p>

<p>“It was my fault,” said Harry; “and I beg everybody’s
pardon. I’ll strip and duck for the things
till I find them.” So saying, he threw off his clothes
and sprang into the canal. Joe, who was, next to
Harry, the best swimmer of the party, followed his
example; and a number of the villagers and “canalers”
collected on the tow-path to watch the divers.</p>

<p>The canal was not more than eight feet deep, but
the bottom was very muddy, and the boys had to
feel about in the mud with their feet for the lost articles.
They were very fortunate, and before long
succeeded in recovering all the shoes, except one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Joe’s, and several other things. Meanwhile three
women and half a dozen girls, all of whom lived on
board the fleet of canal-boats that were lying near
by, joined the spectators, and seemed to think that
the whole business was a capital joke. Harry and
Joe were now anxious to come out of the water; but
they could not come ashore while the women and
girls were there, so they swam some distance up the
canal, and crept out behind a barn.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom and Jim were busily bailing out
the boat, and arranging the wet things so that the
sun could dry them. They were so busy that they
forgot all about Harry and Joe. Presently Tom
said, “Hark! I think I hear somebody calling.”</p>

<p>They listened, and presently they heard a voice in
the distance calling, “Tom! Jim! boys! somebody!
Bring us our clothes!”</p>

<p>“It’s Harry and Joe,” exclaimed Tom. “Where
on earth are they?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="112a"><img src="images/i_112a.jpg" alt="HARRY AND JOE IN A TRAP" /></div>
<p class="caption">HARRY AND JOE IN A TRAP.</p>

<p>They looked up the canal, and finally discovered a
naked arm waving frantically from behind a barn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
that stood near the water. “They must be behind
that barn,” said Tom. “Why, the mosquitoes will
eat ’em alive! I’ll take their clothes to them right
away.” So saying, Tom gathered up the shirts, trousers,
and hats of the two unhappy divers, and ran
with them to their owners. He found Harry and
Joe crouched behind the barn, chattering with cold
and surrounded by clouds of eager mosquitoes.
“We’ve been here half an hour,” cried Joe, “and
the mosquitoes would have finished us in another
half-hour. I think my right leg is nearly gone already.”</p>

<p>“And I know I must have lost a gallon of blood,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>“But why on earth did you come here?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“Because the canal is just lined with women and
girls,” replied Joe. “They think it’s a circus; but
I’m not going to do circus-acting without tights.”</p>

<p>The boys hurriedly dressed themselves, and returning
to the boat helped to put it on the wagon;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and with the wet shoes hanging from the cart-rungs
they started on their ride to Warrensburg. It was
a hot and tedious ride, and as the wagon had no
springs, the boys were bumped so terribly that they
ached all over. They tried to sing, but the words
were bumped out of them in the most startling way;
and after singing one verse of the Star-spangled Banner
in this fashion,</p>

<p class="center">“The St-t-tar-spangl-led-led ba-a-an-na-na—”</p>

<p>they gave it up.</p>

<p>About four o’clock they reached Warrensburg,
and after getting some dry sugar to replace that
which had been mixed with canal water, they
launched the boat, and rowed up the river. They
found it a narrow stream, with a rapid current and a
good depth of water. After their tiresome ride the
smooth motion of the boat seemed delightful, and
they were really sorry when they found it was so
late that they must camp for the night.</p>

<p>They chose a pleasant sandy spot between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
river and the edge of a thick wood. The opposite
bank was also thickly wooded, and they felt as if
they were in the depths of a wilderness; though, in
reality, there were houses quite near at hand. They
pitched their tent, made a good supper—of which
they were in need, for they had eaten very little at
noon—and then “turned in.”</p>

<p>For some reason—perhaps because the mosquitoes
had so cruelly maltreated him—Joe was not sleepy;
and after having lain awake a long time while the
other boys were sleeping soundly, he began to feel
lonesome. He heard a great many mysterious noises,
as any one who lies awake in a tent always does.
The melancholy call of the loon sounded ghostly,
and the sighing of the wind in the trees seemed to
him like the breathing of huge animals. After
awhile he found himself getting nervous as well as
lonesome, and imagined that he saw shadows of
strange objects passing in front of the tent. By-and-by
he distinctly heard the twigs and branches crackling,
as somebody or something moved through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
woods. The noise came nearer, and suddenly it
flashed upon Joe that a bear was approaching the
tent. He crept carefully to the opening of the tent,
and putting his head out, saw indistinctly a large
animal moving slowly in the shadow of the bushes
only three or four rods from the tent.</p>

<p>Joe lost no time in waking up the other boys, cautioning
them as he did so not to make the least noise.
“There’s a bear close by the tent,” he whispered.
“I’ve been listening to him for a long while, and just
now I saw him.”</p>

<p>Harry immediately grasped the gun, both barrels
of which he had loaded before going to sleep. Tom
wished that he had the hatchet, but as it had been
left in the boat, he had no weapon but his penknife.
Thus armed, the two crept stealthily out of the tent
to fight the bear, leaving Joe and Jim in a very unhappy
state of mind, with nothing to defend themselves
against the bear, in case he should attack the
tent, except a tooth-brush and a lantern.</p>

<p>The outline of the animal could be seen, but Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
and Harry could not make out which end of it was
its head. “You must shoot him just behind the
shoulder,” whispered Tom. “That’s the only spot
where you can kill a bear.” Harry said nothing, but
watched carefully to see the animal move. Presently
it threw up either its head or tail—the boys could
not tell which—and started toward the tent. Harry
forgot all about shooting at the shoulder, but in
his excitement fired at the animal generally, without
picking out any particular spot in which to plant
his shot.</p>

<p>The effect of the shot was surprising. The bear
set up a tremendous bellow, and by the flash of the
gun the boys saw their dreaded enemy galloping
away, with its horns and tail in the air. Tom burst
into a loud laugh. “Come out, Joe,” he cried.
“Your bear’s gone home to be milked—that is, if
Harry hasn’t mortally wounded her.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, Harry had made a miss; and he
found his whole charge of shot the next morning
in the trunk of a big white birch-tree. The innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
cow that Joe had mistaken for a bear was, however,
so thoroughly frightened that she did not come near
the camp again.</p>

<p>“I stick to it that it was a bear!” said Joe, as the
boys were wrapping themselves in their blankets.
“Cows go to roost at sunset. Suppose it did bellow:
how do you know that bears don’t bellow when they
are shot?”</p>

<p>“How about the horns, Joe?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“There’s horned owls—why shouldn’t there be
horned bears? Anyway, I believe it was a bear,
and I shall stick to it.” And to this day Joe believes—or
thinks he does—that he had a very narrow
escape from a ferocious bear on the banks of
the Schroon.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_007.jpg" width="75" height="72" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE cruise up the Schroon was a delightful
one while it lasted. The river was so narrow
that the trees on either side frequently
met, forming a green and shady arch. Although
there was a road not far from the river, and there
were houses and small villages at a little distance
from its banks, the boys while in their boat saw
nothing but the water, the trees, and the sky, and
felt as far removed from civilization as if they were
sailing on an African river. They saw nothing to
shoot, after their adventure with Joe’s bear, and
there were no signs of fish in the water; but they
delighted in the wild and solitary river, and were
very much disappointed when, at the close of the
day, they reached a dam so high that it seemed
hopeless to try to carry the boat around it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Before camping they walked some distance above
the dam, and found that the river was completely
blocked up with logs, which had been cut in the forest
above and floated down to the saw-mill. The
men at the mill said that the boys would find the
river choked with logs for a distance of nearly three
miles, and that a little farther up it became a mere
brook, too shallow and rapid to be navigated with
the <i>Whitewing</i>.</p>

<p>It was clear that the cruise on the Schroon had
come to an end, and that it would be necessary to
hire a wagon to take the boat to the lake. Having
reached this decision, the boys made their camp;
and being very tired, put off engaging a team until
morning.</p>

<p>When morning came, one of the men at the mill
came to see them while they were at breakfast, and
advised them not to go to Schroon Lake. He said
that the lake was full of houses—by which he meant
that there were a great many houses along its banks—and
that if they were to go there they would find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
neither shooting nor fishing. He urged them to go
to another lake which they had never heard of
before—Brandt Lake. It was no farther off than
Schroon Lake, and was full of fish. Besides, it was
a wild mountain lake, with only two or three houses
near it. The boys thanked him, and gladly accepted
his advice. They had supposed that Schroon
Lake was in the wilderness, and were exceedingly
glad to find out their mistake in time to select a
more attractive place. The owner of the saw-mill
furnished them with a wagon, and soon after breakfast
they started for Brandt Lake.</p>

<p>When, after a pleasant ride, they came in sight of
the lake, they were overjoyed to find how wild and
beautiful it was. Steep and thickly wooded hills
surrounded it, except at the extreme southern point,
where they launched their boat. It was not more
than two miles wide at the widest part, and was
about five miles in length, and they could see but
two houses—one on the east, and the other on the
west shore. They eagerly hoisted the sail, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
started up the lake to search for a permanent camping-ground;
and, after spending the afternoon in examining
almost the entire line of shore, they selected
a little rocky island in the upper part of the lake,
which seemed made for their purpose.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of work to be done, for
they intended to stay at Brandt Lake for a fortnight.
They had to clear away the underbrush, and cut
down several small trees to make room for the tent.
Then a small landing-place had to be built of stones
and logs, so that the boat could approach the island
without striking on the sharp rocks which surrounded
it. Then the stores were all to be taken out of the
boat, and placed where they would be dry and easy
of access. The provisions had by this time become
nearly exhausted; but the boys had been told that
they could get milk, eggs, butter, bread, and vegetables
at one of the houses which was not more than
a mile from the camp, so they were not troubled to
find that of their canned provisions nothing was left
except a can of peaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Of course all this work was not done in one day.
On the afternoon of their arrival at the lake the
boys merely pitched the tent, and then went fishing
with a view to supper. Fishing with drop-lines
from a large rock at one end of their little island,
they caught perch as fast as they could pull them in,
good-sized pickerel, and two or three cat-fish. That
night they ate a supper that would have made a
boarding-house keeper weep tears of despair, and went
to bed rather happier than they had ever felt before.</p>

<p>Tom was to row over to the house for milk and
other provisions in the morning; but when morning
came the boat was gone. She had broken loose during
the night, not having been properly fastened, and
had floated quietly away. A faint speck was visible
on the surface of the lake about two miles away,
which Harry, who had remarkably good eyes, said
was the <i>Whitewing</i>. Whether he was right or wrong,
it was quite certain that the boys were imprisoned
on the island, with nothing to eat but a can of peaches
and some coffee and sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>The fish, however, were waiting to be caught, and
before very long a breakfast of fish and of coffee
without milk was ready. The boys then began to
discuss the important question of how they were to
get back their boat, or to get away from the island.</p>

<p>It was a mile to the shore, and nobody felt able to
swim that distance. Joe proposed that they fasten
one of their shirts to a tall tree, as a signal of distress,
and then fire the gun every minute. The objection
to this plan was that the nearest house was
out of sight behind a little point of land, and that
no one would see the signal, or would understand
why the gun was fired. Then Tom proposed to
build a raft, on which two boys could paddle after
the runaway boat. This was a practicable suggestion,
and it was at once put into execution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="124a"><img src="images/i_124a.jpg" alt="HARRY SETS OUT IN PURSUIT OF THE BOAT" /></div>
<p class="caption">HARRY SETS OUT IN PURSUIT OF THE BOAT.</p>

<p>It was hard work to cut down timber enough to
build a raft, but by perseverance the raft was finished
before noon. It consisted of four logs laid side
by side, and bound together with handkerchiefs, shoe-strings,
green twigs, and a few strips from one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Harry’s shirts, which he said was unnecessarily long.
It was covered with two or three pieces of flat driftwood;
and when it was finished a piece of board
was found which was shaped with the hatchet into
a rude paddle. Then Tom and Harry proceeded to
embark.</p>

<p>The raft floated Harry very well, but promptly
sank when Tom also stepped on it. Either more
timber must be added to it, or one boy must go
alone in search of the boat. Harry insisted upon going
at once, and as the lake was perfectly smooth,
and he could swim well, there did not seem to be
great risk in his making the voyage alone. Bidding
the boys good-bye, he paddled slowly away, and
left his comrades to anxiously wait for his return.</p>

<p>It was ticklish work paddling the raft. The logs
were fastened together so insecurely, owing to the
fact that all the rope was in the runaway boat, that
Harry was in constant fear that they would come
apart, and was obliged to paddle very carefully to
avoid putting any strain on the raft. With such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
craft speed was out of the question; and after an
hour of hard work the raft was only half-way between
the island and the boat. Harry was not easily
discouraged, however, and he paddled on, knowing
that if nothing happened he must reach the boat
in course of time.</p>

<p>Something did happen. When, after paddling
for more than two hours, the <i>Whitewing</i> was rather
less than a quarter of a mile from the raft, Harry
missed a stroke with his paddle, and tumbled over.
He struck the raft with his shoulder, and went
through it as easily as if it had been fastened together
with paper. When he came to the surface
again he found that the raft had separated into its
original logs, and that his voyage on it was ended.
Luckily the <i>Whitewing</i> was now within swimming distance,
so he struck out for her, and finally crept into
her over the stern, so much exhausted that he had
to lie down and rest before taking to the oars. Had
the raft gone to pieces half an hour sooner he would
have been in a dangerous position; for it is doubtful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
if he could have clung to one of the logs long enough
to drift to the shore without becoming totally exhausted.</p>

<p>The boys on the island did not witness the end
of Harry’s raft, for it was too far away when the accident
occurred for them to see anything but a little
black dot on the water. They became, however,
very anxious about him as the hours went by and
he did not come back. Tom was especially uneasy,
and blamed himself for permitting Harry to go
alone. He thought of making another raft and going
in search of Harry; but there were no more
strings with which to fasten logs together, and he
did not quite like to tear up his clothes and use
them for that purpose. He did, however, resolve
that, if Harry did not come in sight within another
hour, he would take a small log and, putting it under
his arms, try to swim to the main-land and borrow
a boat, if one could be found, in which to search for
his comrade. He was spared this hazardous experiment;
for toward the end of the afternoon Harry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the <i>Whitewing</i> came in sight, and were welcomed
with a tremendous cheer.</p>

<p>Tom took the boat and went for provisions, and
when he returned the <i>Whitewing</i> was not only dragged
on shore, but fastened to two different trees with
two distinct ropes. The boys were determined that
she should not escape again; and when Joe proposed
that somebody should sit up with her all night, so
that she could not cut the ropes and run away, Tom
seriously considered the proposal. The next day a
snug little dock was built, in which she seemed quite
contented, and from which she could not escape without
climbing over a stone breakwater—a feat of
which there was no reason to believe that she was
capable.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE boys had been on their island for more
than a week when they resolved to make an
excursion to Schroon, which was the nearest
village, in order to get some sugar, coffee, and other
necessaries. Schroon Lake, or rather the lower end
of it, was not more than five miles from Brandt
Lake; but there was a range of high hills between
the two, and the village of Schroon was situated at
the head of the lake, which was nearly ten miles in
length. A long and tiresome journey was, therefore,
before them, and they ought to have started early in
the morning; but they did not start until nearly
eleven o’clock. Harry, Tom, and Joe were to go
to Schroon together, and Jim was to stay at the
island until six o’clock, when he was to row over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
to the west shore and bring the others back to the
camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="130a"><img src="images/i_130a.jpg" alt="BIDDING JIM GOOD-BYE" /></div>
<p class="caption">BIDDING JIM GOOD-BYE.</p>

<p>When they bade good-bye to Jim, the three other
boys assured him that they would certainly be
back as early as six o’clock, and warned him not
to fail to meet them with the boat. They then
started to cross the hills, following a foot-path, that
was so little used that it was hardly visible. Unfortunately
the path led through a thicket of raspberry
bushes, and the fruit was so tempting that the
boys lost a good deal of time by stopping to gather
it. After a tiresome tramp under the mid-day sun
they reached the lower end of Schroon Lake, where
they hired a crank little row-boat, and rowed up to
Schroon. There was a fresh northerly breeze which
delayed them; and the spray from the bow of the
boat sprinkled them, so that they were uncomfortably
wet when they reached the village. By this
time they were very hungry as well as tired, and so
they went to the hotel for dinner. It was half-past
six o’clock when they started to row down the lake,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>and several men who saw them warned them that
they were running a good deal of risk in attempting
to return at so late an hour.</p>

<p>The trip down the lake was certainly a rather
foolhardy one; for there was a good deal of wind
and sea, and long before they reached the landing-place
it was quite dark. But the boys were anxious
to get back to their camp, and for the first time during
the cruise they acted somewhat recklessly. However,
they met with no accident; and when they had
returned the boat to its owner, they set out to cross
the hills.</p>

<p>The path was not easy to find in the daylight,
and it was next to impossible to find it in the night.
A dozen times the boys lost themselves, and were
compelled to depend entirely upon the stars to direct
their course. The woods had been all cleared away
for a space of a mile or a mile and a half wide between
the two lakes, except just along the shore of
Brandt Lake; so that it was not absolutely necessary
for them to keep in the path, as it would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
had they been passing through a thick forest. Still
it was not pleasant to lose the path, and stumble
over stones and stumps, and of course it made the
journey longer. They must have walked at least
seven or eight miles on their way back before they
finally reached their own lake at midnight, at the
point where they expected to find Jim waiting for
them.</p>

<p>Neither Jim nor the boat was there. He had
waited until ten o’clock, and then, making up his
mind that they had decided to spend the night at
Schroon, he rowed back to the island, and went
calmly to bed. An hour later a dense fog settled over
the lake; and when the tired boys reached the shore
they could see but a few yards in front of their eyes.</p>

<p>It was a terrible disappointment, but Harry tried
to be cheerful. “We shall have to stay here to-night,
boys,” said he; “but we will build a good fire
and keep warm.” Tom said that he thought that
was the best thing to do, for without a fire they
would suffer severely from the cold, wet fog, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
asked Harry if he had any matches. Harry had
none, Joe had none, and Tom had none; so the plan
of building a fire came to nothing.</p>

<p>The cold gradually chilled them as they stood
talking over their adventure, and their teeth began
to chatter. Joe said he wished he could get hold of
Jim for about five minutes, so that he could warm himself
up by convincing him that he ought not to have
taken the boat back to the island. Harry said nothing;
but he was wondering whether he would freeze
to death in the fog, and tried to remember how travellers
overtaken by the snow on the Alps contrive to
fight off the terrible drowsiness that steals over them
when they are freezing. Tom was more practical.
He did not expect to freeze in July, although he was
miserably cold; and he did not want to punish Jim
for a mistake of judgment. He knew that the house
where they were accustomed to get milk was not far
off, and that a boat usually lay on the shore near
the house; so he proposed to Harry and Joe to borrow
the boat and make their way into the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“If we go to that house at this time of night, we
shall get shot,” remarked Harry. “The man is an
ugly-tempered chap, and I heard him say the other
day that if he ever heard anything prowling around
the house at night, he always fired at it.”</p>

<p>“Then we won’t ask him for his boat: we’ll borrow
it without leave, and Jim can bring it back in
the morning,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“This is nice conduct for Moral Pirates,” said Joe.
“Capturing a vessel at night is real piracy, and when
Jim takes the boat back the man will be sure to
shoot him. I’m sorry for Jim; but I hope it will be
a warning to him not to leave his friends in such a
fix that they’ve either got to borrow a boat without
leave, or freeze.”</p>

<p>They made their way stealthily and with great
difficulty to the place where the boat lay. It was
high and dry on the beach, and though the fog hid
the house where the owner of the boat lived, the
boys knew that it was very near. They launched
the boat with the utmost caution, lest any noise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
should awaken the bad-tempered man with the shotgun.
They had it almost launched, when Harry’s
foot slipped on a wet stone, and he fell with a dismal
crash, clinging to the boat, and dragging Tom
and Joe down with him.</p>

<p>It was very certain that if anything could wake
the owner of the boat, he must be awake by this
time; so the boys sprang up, and shoving the boat
into the water regardless of the noise, seized the oars,
and rowed away into the fog. When they had gained
what they thought a safe distance from the shore
they ceased rowing, and congratulated themselves
that they were all right at last. To be sure, Harry
had scraped his ankle badly; Tom had forgotten the
coffee, and left it on the shore; and Joe had put the
sugar in the bottom of the leaky boat, where it was
rapidly dissolving into sirup; but they were once
more afloat, and expected to reach their comfortable
camp within the next twenty minutes.</p>

<p>There was not a particle of air stirring, and not a
star was visible, so they had absolutely nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
steer by. They could not even hear the sound of
the water which ordinarily lapped the shore. Still
they were not discouraged. Harry thought he knew
which way the camp lay, and so he and Tom rowed
in what they imagined was the right direction.</p>

<p>They rowed for two hours without finding the
island, and without reaching the shore. They could
not understand it. The lake seemed to have grown
in the night, and to have reached the size of Lake
Ontario. They knew that by daylight they could
row across it at its widest part in less than an hour,
but now it seemed impossible to find any shore.
Joe had just suggested that they had made a mistake
in coming back from Schroon, and had walked all
the way to Lake Champlain, on which they were
now rowing, when the bow of the boat struck the
shore.</p>

<p>It was some consolation to know that the lake
actually had a shore; but they could not tell what
part of the shore they had reached. They pushed
off again, and resumed their hopeless search for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
camp. A new trouble now harassed them. From
seeming to have no shore at all, the lake now seemed
to have shrunk to a mere mud-puddle. No matter
in what direction they rowed, they would strike
the shore within ten minutes, and always at a different
place. Joe said that he had never dreamed that
so much shore and so little lake could be put together.</p>

<p>Toward morning Harry and Tom became too tired
to row, and they lay down in the bottom of the wet
boat, and tried to keep warm by lying close to each
other. Joe took the oars, and tried to row without
hitting the shore; but he had hardly dipped his oars
when the bow grated on the pebbles. He promptly
gave up the attempt, and making the boat fast to a
tree, joined Tom and Harry, and shared their misery.</p>

<p>They were much too cold and wretched to sleep,
but they managed to keep from growing positively
stiff with cold. The sun rose, but it did not for a
long time make any impression on the fog. All at
once, about seven o’clock, the fog vanished; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
boys found themselves in a little bay near the extreme
northerly part of the lake. They had been
rowing across this little bay, first in one direction
and then in another, during all those miserable
hours when they found such an unaccountable quantity
of shore.</p>

<p>Of course they rowed down to the camp, where
they found Jim still sleeping soundly, with a contented,
happy look that was awfully exasperating. They
woke him up, and scolded him with all the strength
they had left, and then, putting on dry clothes, “turned
in,” and slept all day. Jim towed the borrowed
boat back, but was not shot; and the boys afterward
said that, on the whole, they were rather glad that
he still lived, and that they would mercifully forgive
him.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was only one fault to be found with
Brandt Lake; there was hardly anything to
shoot in its vicinity. Occasionally a deer
could be found; but at the season of the year when
the boys were at the lake it was contrary to law to
kill deer. It was known that there were bears in
that part of the country as well as lynxes—or catamounts,
as they are generally called; but they were
so scarce that no one thought of hunting them.
Harry did succeed in shooting three pigeons and a
quail, and Tom shot a gray squirrel; but the bears,
deer, catamounts, and ducks that they had expected
to shoot did not show themselves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they had any quantity of fishing.
Perch and cat-fish swarmed all around the island;
and large pickerel, some of them weighing six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
or eight pounds, could be caught by trolling. Two
miles farther north was another lake that was full
of trout, and the boys visited it several times, and
found out how delicious a trout is when it is cooked
within half an hour after it is taken out of the water.
In fact they lived principally upon fish, and became
so dainty that they would not condescend to cook
any but the choicest trout, and the plumpest cat-fish
and pickerel.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that there was a good deal
of monotony in their daily life. In the morning
somebody went for milk, after which breakfast was
cooked and eaten. Then one of the boys would
take the gun and tramp through the woods in the
hope of finding something to shoot, while the others
would either go fishing or lie in the shade. Once
they devoted a whole day to circumnavigating the
lake in the boat, and another day a long rain-storm
kept them inside of the tent most of the time. With
these exceptions one day was remarkably like another;
and at the end of two weeks they began to grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
a little tired of camping, and to remember that there
were ways of enjoying themselves at home.</p>

<p>Their final departure from their island camp was
caused by an accident. They had decided to row to
the southern end of the lake and engage a team to
meet them the following week and to carry them to
Glenn’s Falls, where they intended to ship the boat
on board a canal-boat bound for New York, and to
return home by rail. To avoid the heat of the sun,
they started down the lake immediately after breakfast,
and forgot to put out the fire before they left
the island.</p>

<p>After they had rowed at least a mile, Tom, who
sat facing the stern, noticed a light wreath of
smoke rising from the island, and remarked, “Our
fire is burning yet. We ought not to have gone off
and left it.”</p>

<p>Harry looked back, and saw that the cloud of
smoke was rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>“It’s not the fire that’s making all that smoke!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“What is it, then?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s water,” said Joe. “I always thought
that where there was smoke there must be fire; but
Harry says it isn’t fire.”</p>

<p>“I mean,” continued Harry, “that we didn’t leave
fire enough to make so much smoke. It must have
spread and caught something.”</p>

<p>“Caught the tent, most likely,” said Tom. “Let’s
row back right away and put it out.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” interrupted Jim. “That tent
is as dry as tinder, and will burn up before we can
get half-way there.”</p>

<p>“We must get back as soon as we can,” cried Harry.
“All our things are in the tent. Row your
best, boys, and we may save them yet.”</p>

<p>The boat was quickly turned, and headed toward
the camp. The fire was rapidly increasing, and it
was apparent that the dry underbrush must have
caught; in which case the fire would soon fasten on
the trees, and sweep over the whole of the little
island.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="143a"><img src="images/i_142b.jpg" alt="THE EXPLOSION IN CAMP" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE EXPLOSION IN CAMP.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“There’s one reason why I’m not particularly anxious
to help put that fire out,” Joe remarked, as they
approached the island, and could see that a really
alarming fire was in progress.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“As near as I can calculate, there must be about
two pounds—”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a loud report from the
island, and a shower of pebbles, sticks, and small articles—among
which a shoe and a tin pail were recognized—shot
into the air.</p>

<p>—“Of powder,” Joe continued, “in the flask. I
thought it would blow up, and now that it’s all gone
I don’t mind landing on the island.”</p>

<p>“Everything must be ruined!” exclaimed Jim.</p>

<p>“Lucky for us that we put on our shoes this morning,”
Tom remarked, as he rowed steadily on. “That
must have been one of my other pair that just went
up. I remember I put them in the corner of the
tent close by the powder.”</p>

<p>When they reached the island they could not at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
first land, on account of the heat of the flames; but
they could plainly see that the tent and everything
in it had been totally destroyed. After waiting for
half an hour the fire burnt itself out, so that they
could approach their dock and land on the smoking
ash heap that an hour before had been such a beautiful,
shady spot. There was hardly anything left
that was of any use. A tin pan, a fork, and the
hatchet were found uninjured; but all their clothing
and other stores were either burnt to ashes or so
badly scorched as to be useless. Quite overwhelmed
by their disaster, the boys sat down and looked
at one another.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go home now, whether we want to
or not,” Harry said, as he poked the ashes idly with
a stick.</p>

<p>“Well, we meant to go home in a few days anyway,”
said Tom; “so the fire hasn’t got very much
the better of us.”</p>

<p>“But I hate to have everything spoiled, and to
have to go in this sort of way. Our tin pans and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
fishing-tackle aren’t worth much, but all our spare
clothes have gone.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got your uncle’s gun in the boat, so that’s
all right,” suggested Tom, encouragingly. “As long
as the gun and the boat are safe, we needn’t mind
about a few flannel shirts and things.”</p>

<p>“But it’s such a pity to be driven away when we
were having such a lovely time,” continued Harry.</p>

<p>“That’s rubbish, Harry,” said Joe. “We were all
beginning to get tired of camping out. I think it’s
jolly to have the cruise end this way, with a lot of
fireworks. It’s like the transformation scene at the
theatre. Besides, it saves us the trouble of carrying
a whole lot of things back with us.”</p>

<p>“The thing to do now,” remarked Tom, “is to row
right down to the outlet, and get a team to take us
to Glenn’s Falls this afternoon. We can’t sleep here,
unless we build a hut, and then we wouldn’t have
a blanket to cover us. Don’t let’s waste any more
time talking about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so! Take your places in the boat, boys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and we’ll start for home.” So saying, Harry led the
way to the boat, and in a few moments the <i>Whitewing</i>
was homeward bound.</p>

<p>The boys were lucky enough to find a man who
engaged to take them to Glenn’s Falls in time to
catch the afternoon train for Albany. They stopped
at the Falls only long enough to see the <i>Whitewing</i>
safely on board a canal-boat, and they reached Albany
in time to go down the river on the night-boat.</p>

<p>After a supper that filled the colored waiters with
astonishment and horror, the boys selected arm-chairs
on the forward deck, and began to talk over the
cruise. They all agreed that they had had a splendid
time, in spite of hard work and frequent wettings.</p>

<p>“We’ll go on another cruise next summer, sure,”
said Harry. “Where shall we go?”</p>

<p>Tom was the first to reply. Said he, “I’ve been
thinking that we can do better than we did this
time.”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked the other boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“The <i>Whitewing</i> is an awfully nice boat,” Tom
continued, “but she is too small. We ought to have
a boat that we can sleep in comfortably, and without
getting wet every night.”</p>

<p>“But, then,” Harry suggested, “you couldn’t drag
a bigger boat round a dam.”</p>

<p>“We can’t drag the <i>Whitewing</i> round much of a
dam. She’s too big to be handled on land, and too
little to be comfortable. Now, here’s my plan.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it,” cried the other boys.</p>

<p>“We can hire a cat-boat about twenty feet long,
and she’ll be big enough, so that we can rig up a
canvas cabin at night. We can anchor her, and
sleep on board her every night. We can carry mattresses,
so we needn’t sleep on stones and stumps—”</p>

<p>—“And coffee-pots,” interrupted Joe.</p>

<p>—“And we can take lots of things, and live comfortably.
We can sail instead of rowing; and
though I like to row as well as the next fellow,
we’ve had a little too much of that. Now we’ll get
a cat-boat next summer, and we’ll cruise from New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
York Bay to Montauk Point. We can go all the
way through the bays on the south side, and there
are only three places where we will have to get a
team of horses to drag the boat across a little bit
of flat meadow. I know all about it, for I studied
it out on the map one day. What do you say for
that for a cruise?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“And I’ll go,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the cat-boat!” said Joe. “We can
be twice as moral and piratical in a sail-boat as we
can in a row-boat, even if it is the dear little <i>Whitewing</i>.”</p>
